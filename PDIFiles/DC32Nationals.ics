DESCRIPTION:Loss: 5-8\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nSAN DIEGO -- If the
  Nationals don't win the National League Wild Card\, they can look at th
 e game on Saturday night as the turning point of their season.\nThe Nati
 onals blew a 5-0 lead and lost to the Padres\, 8-5\, in 12 innings in fr
 ont of 37\,707 at PETCO Park.\n\nThe loss broke the Nationals' four-game
  winning streak. They are now 3 1/2 games behind the Astros in the Natio
 nal League Wild Card race.\n\nIt was a game that will leave people secon
 d-guessing manager Frank Robinson for the next few days.\n\nThe National
 s had the five-run lead going into the ninth inning. The skipper decided
  to open the frame with rookie Jason Bergmann\, who has been a pleasant 
 surprise since being called up from Triple-A New Orleans in late August.
  Bergmann has been able to get out of tough situations in the past\, but
  on Saturday\, he wasn't given a chance.\n\nBergmann walked Eric Young t
 o start the inning\, but was able to strike out Ramon Hernandez for the 
 first out.\n\nIn a surprise move\, Robinson decided to take Bergmann out
  of the game in favor of left-hander Joey Eischen.\n\n\"I was a little b
 it surprised [to be taken out]\, but I was in there to face two right-ha
 nded hitters\,\" Bergmann said. \"Then [Padres right fielder Brian] Gile
 s\, the lefty\, came up. With one swing of the bat\, he could pull them 
 within a couple of runs. Eischen is down there and he is a lefty.\"\n\nE
 ischen was able to get Giles to fly out to Preston Wilson\, but Xavier N
 ady followed with a single to put runners on first and second.\n\nThen d
 isaster struck for the Nationals. Robinson brought in Travis Hughes\, wh
 o gave up an RBI single to Joe Randa to make it a 5-1 game. Closer Chad 
 Cordero was brought in to close it out. On this night\, Cordero had noth
 ing on his fastball. He walked Mark Loretta to load the bases and shorts
 top Khalil Greene took a 1-0 pitch over the wall in left-center field fo
 r a grand slam to tie the score at 5.\n\n\"I just went out there and ble
 w it again\,\" Cordero said. \"I threw the ball out in the middle of the
  plate. I tried to go away and it ran back over. He made me pay for it.\
 "\n\nDuring the month of September\, Cordero has given up eight runs in 
 six innings and blown three games. The 23-year-old has pitched in a care
 er high 72 games and admitted to feeling a little run-down.\n\n\"You rea
 lly get tired\, but that's no excuse. I still have to make the pitches\,
 \" Cordero said.\n\nAsked why he made so many moves with a big lead\, Ro
 binson said\, \"I made the moves that I made all year long\, the moves I
  thought would get us out of an inning.\"\n\nThe game went into extra in
 nings and it was Jon Rauch's game to win or lose. After holding the Padr
 es scoreless in the 10th and 11th innings\, Rauch allowed two runners to
  reach base in the 12th\, but there was nobody warming up in the bullpen
 . All of Robinson's best relievers were already used\; only John Halama 
 and Darrell Ranser remained in the 'pen\, but Robinson stuck with Rauch.
 \n\nWith two outs\, Hernandez took the first pitch from Rauch over the l
 eft-field wall to give the Padres the victory.\n\n\"I hung a curveball\,
  and you can't do that up here\,\" Rauch said. \"I don't care who the hi
 tter is. You just can't do it. I left it right down the middle and up an
 d he took advantage of it.\n\n\"It just one of those freaky games you lo
 ok back on and ask\, 'How did that happen?' It's done. It's over with\, 
 forget about it and move on to the next game.\"\n\nIt wasn't easy for Ro
 binson to forget about the game. After putting on his street clothes\, h
 e was spotted sitting back in his chair. The skipper said he blamed hims
 elf for the loss\, but didn't go into details.\n\nThe loss spoiled a gre
 at outing by Hector Carrasco\, who was making his second consecutive sta
 rt for the Nationals. He threw six shutout innings and gave up just thre
 e hits\, struck out three batters and walked one.\n\n\"He was outstandin
 g. He threw the ball very well. He minimized his pitches\,\" pitching co
 ach Randy St. Claire said.\n\nCarrasco's counterpart\, right-hander Adam
  Eaton\, gave up four runs in 5 1/3 innings. The Nationals took a 1-0 le
 ad in the second when Nick Johnson launched the first pitch from Eaton o
 ff the balcony of the Western Metal Supply Co. building behind the left-
 field wall.\n\nIn the following inning\, Jose Vidro hit a sacrifice fly 
 to center fielder Dave Roberts\, driving in Cristian Guzman.\n\nJose Gui
 llen made it a 3-0 game in the fifth when he singled to left to drive ho
 me Guzman.\n\nPreston Wilson homered over the left-center-field wall in 
 the sixth for a four-run Nationals advantage. It was Wilson's 24th home 
 run of the season and his ninth as a member of the Nationals.\n\nWith le
 ft-hander Chris Hammond on the mound in the seventh\, Johnson drove in h
 is second run of the game with a single to right field\, driving in Kenn
 y Kelly.\n\nThis story was not subject to the approval of Major League B

SUMMARY:(L) @ Atlanta
DESCRIPTION:make-up for the rainout on 8/29/05\n\nLoss: 3-5\n\nBy Bill L
 adson / MLB.com\n\nATLANTA -- If right-hander Esteban Loaiza didn't have
  to face outfielder Andruw Jones on Wednesday\, he would have had a shut
 out for 4 1/3 innings.\nBut the reality was\, Jones was in the Braves' l
 ineup and proved to be too much for the Nationals\, who lost\, 5-3\, in 
 the first game of a doubleheader on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe National
 s now find themselves seven games behind the Braves in the National Leag
 ue East and two games behind the Marlins and Phillies in the National Le
 ague Wild Card race after Game 1.\n\nJones hit a three-run home run and 
 drove in all five runs against Loaiza\, who lasted just 4 1/3 innings an
 d gave up seven hits and four walks.\n\n\"We needed a better performance
  out of Loaiza to have a chance to win the ballgame\,\" manager Frank Ro
 binson said. \"We didn't get it.\"\n\nIt was the fifth inning that prove
 d to be the difference for the Braves. With the bases loaded and the sco
 re tied at 3\, Jones singled to right-center field to drive in Ryan Lang
 erhans and Marcus Giles.\n\n\"It was supposed to be a cutter away\, and 
 it was low and away\, and he made good contact with it and got two RBIs 
 out of it\,\" Loaiza said. \"They got five runs and those five runs came
  from Andruw Jones. If they didn't\, we would have won\, 3-0.\"\n\nLoaiz
 a said if he had a vote\, Jones would be his NL MVP.\n\n\"He is having a
  great season in the second half\,\" Loaiza said. \"The first half\, he 
 was lost and now he is just locked in and doing great.\"\n\nThe National
 s had an opportunity to tie the score in the bottom of the eighth inning
 .\n\nWith Chris Reitsma on the mound\, the Nationals had runners on firs
 t and second and no outs. But Reitsma struck out Preston Wilson for the 
 first out.\n\nManager Bobby Cox then brought in Kyle Farnsworth\, and th
 ings started to unravel for the Nationals. Catcher Brian McCann picked o
 ff Jose Guillen at first base. The replay appeared to show that Guillen 
 was safe\, but Robinson didn't seem to care about that.\n\n\"That just c
 an't happen\,\" Robinson said. \"The first-base coach can't let it happe
 n and [Guillen] can't let it happen.\"\n\nVinny Castilla ended the innin
 g by grounding out to second.\n\n\"In close ballgames\, they come back t
 o haunt you\,\" Robinson said. \"You have to take advantage of your oppo
 rtunities.\"\n\nThe Nationals gave Loaiza a 1-0 lead in the first\, when
  Guillen singled off Braves starter Horacio Ramirez to drive in Marlon B
 yrd.\n\nBut Jones quickly gave the Braves a two-run lead in the bottom o
 f the inning\, when he hit a three-run shot that barely cleared the left
 -field fence.\n\nThe Nationals tied the score by the top of the fifth. I
 n the third\, Byrd scored on a Nick Johnson groundout\, and in the fifth
 \, Byrd hit his first home run in a Nationals uniform.\n\nByrd\, an Atla
 nta native\, ended up going 3-for-5 and was a triple short of the cycle.
 \n\n\"He had an excellent ballgame\,\" Robinson said. \"There wasn't muc
 h more that he could do. We didn't have people on base when he came up t
 o hit. He did all he could do.\"\n\nThis story was not subject to the ap

DESCRIPTION:Loss: 3-5\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nMILWAUKEE -- One wo
 uld think the Nationals would have an idea on how to hit Brewers right-h
 ander Tomo Ohka. After all\, Ohka was with Washington until June 10\, wh
 en it dealt the right-hander to the Brewers for second baseman Junior Sp
 ivey.\nHowever\, Ohka baffled the Nationals for seven innings and helped
  the Brewers defeat Washington\, 5-3\, in front of 23\,543 at Miller Par
 k on Sunday afternoon. The Brewers took three out of four games in the s
 eries.\n\nThe Nationals have now lost three consecutive series\, all aga
 inst middle-of-the-pack teams -- Mets\, Phillies and Brewers. Still\, th
 e Nationals remain in first place in the National League East\, 1 1/2 ga
 mes ahead of the Braves.\n\n\"We are not playing like we are capable of 
 playing. We are going into a funk right now and we have to find a way to
  get out of it\,\" second baseman Jose Vidro said. \"We were beaten by a
  team that we should be beating. No disrespect to them. We had an opport
 unity to take advantage of it and we didn't.\"\n\nOhka gave up three run
 s on four hits and won his sixth game of the season. He struck out six b
 atters and walked none. It was Ohka's first victory since June 14\, when
  he shut out the Devil Rays in his debut with the Brewers.\n\nVidro said
  Ohka kept the Nationals off-balance by throwing a lot of off-speed pitc
 hes.\n\n\"He kept the ball down and he didn't give us anything to work w
 ith. That was the Ohka that we had in the past\,\" Vidro said.\n\nThe Na
 tionals got off to a good start against Ohka in the first inning\, when 
 Jose Guillen hit his 19th home run of the season to give Washington a on
 e-run lead.\n\nBut it went downhill after that with Ryan Drese on the mo
 und. In the bottom of the first inning\, a Vidro error turned the game a
 round for the Brewers.\n\nWith two outs and a runner of first\, Bill Hal
 l hit a routine ground ball to Vidro\, who booted it and put runners on 
 first and third.\n\nGeoff Jenkins then gave the Brewers a 2-1 lead when 
 he doubled down the right-field line to drive in Rickie Weeks and Hall.\
 n\n\"I don't know if it cost us the ballgame\, but it changed the moment
 um of the game. The approach after that was different\,\" Vidro said.\n\
 nThe Brewers added three more runs and made it a 5-1 game in the third i
 nning against Drese. With runners on second and third and no outs\, Hall
  grounded out to shortstop Cristian Guzman\, but Weeks scored on the pla
 y.\n\nAfter Carlos Lee popped up for the second out\, Russell Branyan dr
 ove in Lyle Overbay and Chad Moeller followed with an RBI single of his 
 own.\n\nDrese lasted three innings and gave up five runs -- three earned
 . He didn't strike out a batter\, but walked one.\n\nDrese is showing si
 gns of being another Zach Day. Like Day\, Drese is a sinkerball pitcher.
  When it's working\, Drese is almost unhittable. But when Drese's balls 
 are up in the strike zone\, the hitters are taking batting practice. The
 re's no middle ground\, where Drese could battle an opponent for six or 
 seven innings.\n\n\"When he's bad\, I guess he's bad\,\" manager Frank R
 obinson said. \"The play by Jose cost him two runs\, so you can't get to
 o upset about that\, but he still wasn't sharp out there. There were a l
 ot of balls that were up. He is supposed to be down in the zone and gett
 ing ground balls and he didn't get them today.\"\n\nThe Nationals made i
 t a two-run game against Ohka in the top of the seventh inning when Bria
 n Schneider doubled down the right-field line to drive in Guillen and Pr
 eston Wilson. Carlos Baerga\, pinch-hitting for Guzman\, represented the
  tying run\, but he popped out to Weeks at second base.\n\nAfter the gam
 e\, Ohka said that he didn't have any extra adrenalin facing the Nationa
 ls. But Brewers manager Ned Yost begged to differ.\n\n\"He's very steady
 . He's not very emotional\, normally he doesn't get real up or real down
 \,\" Yost said. \"But human nature and common sense tells you it had to.
 \"\n\nEven after the acquisition of Wilson\, the Nationals still look le
 thargic on offense. During his three-plus seasons as manager of the fran
 chise\, Robinson usually inserts backup Jamey Carroll whenever the offen
 se needs an offense spark. Asked if Carroll would replace the slumping G
 uzman at shortstop\, Robinson declined to comment. Guzman went 0-for-12 
 in the series against the Brewers and is now hitting .120 for the season
 .\n\n\"It's not that I haven't thought about different things during the
  last two weeks. I'd rather not comment on it\,\" Robinson said.\n\nA te
 am source said that Robinson is thinking about benching Guzman in favor 
 of Carroll. It is Robinson's custom to get a good night's sleep first be
 fore he makes a decision.\n\nAsked what his confidence level was at the 
 plate\, Guzman said\, \"You know when somebody pinch-hits for you so man
 y times\, right away you know you have to get a base hit. [It gets in my
  head] a little bit. It would be a bad decision to bench me. Everybody k
 nows I'm not a bench player.\"\n\nThe Nationals now fly back Washington 
 to play seven games against the Rockies and Astros at RFK Stadium\, wher
 e they have the best home record in baseball. Robinson called the seven 
 games crucial and hopes that the Nationals can have better offensive pro
 duction.\n\n\"We have to get back into a good grove of winning ballgames
 \, playing sharp baseball\, good defense and have solid pitching. It's v
 ery important. We can't continue to go along the lines that we are going
 \,\" Robinson said.\n\nThis story was not subject to the approval of Maj
 or League Baseball or its clubs.

SUMMARY:(L) vs Mets
DESCRIPTION:Loss: 3-5\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- On We
 dnesday night\, Livan Hernandez had his worst outing since April 19\, bu
 t\, according to manager Frank Robinson\, missed opportunities on offens
 e led to the Nationals' 5-3 defeat to the Mets\, in front of 38\,148 at 
 Robert F. Kennedy Stadium.\nThe loss snapped Hernandez' personal streak 
 of 11 consecutive winning decisions. One bad inning proved costly for He
 rnandez -- the top of the sixth inning.\n\nWith the bases loaded\, no ou
 ts and the Nationals leading\, 3-1\, Marlon Anderson had a broken-bat\, 
 infield single down the third-base line\, which scored Carlos Beltran to
  make it a 3-2 game.\n\nLooking for the double play\, Hernandez threw th
 e ball at the middle of the plate\, and Ramon Castro singled to left fie
 ld to score Cliff Floyd and David Wright to give the Mets a 4-3 lead.\n\
 n\"That was get turning point of the game\,\" Hernandez said. \"That's b
 aseball. You are not going to be perfect all the time and win every game
 . I will be better next time.\"\n\nHernandez was almost perfect in the f
 irst half. He was 12-3 with 3.48 ERA and will make his second consecutiv
 e All-Star appearance\, in Detroit on Tuesday. Hernandez\, who will star
 t against the Brewers in the first game of the second half\, talked abou
 t his great run during the first half of the 2005 season.\n\n\"It's not 
 easy to win 12 games in the first half\,\" Hernandez said. \"I'm happy. 
 I'm going to enjoy the All-Star Game with my friends and family. I'm goi
 ng to try and get off to a good start in the second half. I want to win 
 a lot of games in the second half.\"\n\nThe Mets added to their lead in 
 eighth inning. With Hector Carrasco on the mound\, Anderson hit a sacrif
 ice fly to left fielder Marlon Byrd to score Beltran. The run was charge
 d to Hernandez.\n\n\"He didn't have his real good stuff tonight. He wasn
 't real sharp\, but he battled\,\" Robinson said.\n\nLeft-hander Tom Gla
 vine was on the mound for the Mets\, and the last time the Nationals fac
 ed him prior to Wednesday was April 22. In that game\, Glavine was throw
 ing nothing but breaking balls on the outside part of the plate\, and th
 e Nationals could score only one run off him. After that game\, Robinson
  complained his club tried to pull too many balls against the soft-tossi
 ng left-hander.\n\nOn Wednesday\, Robinson thought the Nationals' approa
 ch toward Glavine wasn't good enough\, even though they managed to score
  three runs against him in 5 2/3 innings. Robinson said the Nationals st
 ill tried to pull the ball against Glavine.\n\n\"We still didn't have th
 e right approach against Glavine tonight\,\" Robinson said. \"We were st
 ill trying to pull the ball\, and that is the way he kills you. He has b
 een making a living like that for a long time\, and he got it done tonig
 ht that way.\"\n\nThe Nationals had golden opportunities to score more r
 uns off Glavine in the third and sixth innings. Down\, 1-0\, in the thir
 d\, the Nationals had runners on runners on first and second and one out
 \, Jose Vidro grounded out to put runners on second and third. After Jos
 e Guillen was walked intentionally to load the bases\, Wil Cordero groun
 ded out to end the inning.\n\nIn the sixth\, the Nationals had the bases
  loaded and two outs off Glavine. Mets manager Willie Randolph took Glav
 ine out of the game in favor of Aaron Heilman\, who induced Guillen to g
 round out to end the inning.\n\nThe Nationals left nine runners on base 
 during the game.\n\nThe only time the Nationals took advantage of Glavin
 e was in the fourth inning\, when they scored three runs to take a 3-1 l
 ead.\n\nWith runners on first and third and one out\, Jamey Carroll sing
 led to right field to send home Vinny Castilla and tie the score at 1. A
 fter Hernandez sacrificed Carroll and Byrd to second and third\, respect
 ively\, Brad Wilkerson singled to right-center field to bring home Byrd 
 and Carroll.\n\n\"It looked like one of our ballgames early in the year.
  We scored one inning and that's it\,\" Robinson said. \"We have to get 
 to back together\, and we have to play with a little more fire and a lit
 tle more determination. We have to get it done.\"\n\nGlavine\, Heilman a
 nd Braden Looper shut out the Nationals the rest of the way. Glavine (6-
 7) received the victory while Looper picked up his 19th save of the seas
 on. Heilman was perfect over his 2 1/3 innings.\n\n\"It was a tough loss
 . We had a chance to win. We didn't do it. It's not going to happen ever
 y night. We just have to come back tomorrow and try to do a better job\,
 \" Vidro said.\n\nThe loss drops the Nationals' record to 51-33. They re
 main in first place in the National League East\, four games ahead of th
 e Braves.\n\n\nThis story was not subject to the approval of Major Leagu

DESCRIPTION:Win: 5-4\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nPHILADELPHIA -- Befo
 re the four-game series began\, manager Frank Robinson said that the Nat
 ionals must win at least two games against the Phillies to continue to h
 ave momentum in the National League East and Wild Card races.\nThe Natio
 nals accomplished that goal by coming back from a 4-0 deficit and nippin
 g the Phillies\, 5-4\, splitting the day-night doubleheader on Thursday 
 as well as the four-game series. In the day game\, the Phillies edged th
 e Nationals\, 2-1.\n\nWashington is now five games behind Atlanta in the
  NL East and a half-game behind Philadelphia in the Wild Card race.\n\nA
 t first\, it looked like the Nationals were going to sink even further i
 n the face as the Phillies had a four-run lead after four innings. Right
 -hander Ryan Drese had arguably his worst outing in a Nationals uniform\
 , pitching just four innings and giving up all four runs on five hits.\n
 \n\"He is just getting the ball up too often\, and he just doesn't locat
 e the ball consistently\,\" Robinson said. \"When he throws a sinker\, i
 t's usually out of the strike zone.\"\n\nDrese was honest about his outi
 ng and is lost as to how to fix his problems on the mound. He has given 
 up fewer than four runs in a game only once in his last seven starts.\n\
 n\"I [stunk]. Everything was up. That's the bottom line\,\" Drese said. 
 \"I have no idea what's wrong. My arm might have been a little flat. My 
 breaking ball\, my sinker was up\, everything. Physically\, I feel good 
 and I'm not making the pitches down in the zone.\"\n\nAfter Drese left t
 he game\, however\, the Nationals' relievers -- John Halama\, Luis Ayala
 \, Mike Stanton and Chad Cordero -- shut out the Phillies for the next f
 ive innings and gave the offense a chance to come back. Overall\, the bu
 llpen pitched eight shutout innings in the doubleheader.\n\n\"They did a
  tremendous job today to give us an opportunity to win two ballgames\,\"
  Robinson said.\n\nWashington bailed Drese out by the top of the eighth 
 inning. The Nats were facing right-hander Cory Lidle\, who has given the
  Nationals/Expos fits since he was a member of the Blue Jays. Entering t
 he game\, he was 5-0 with a 2.54 ERA against them. But\, for the first t
 ime\, the Nationals started to figure him out.\n\nIn the top of the fift
 h\, Washington scored three runs against the right-hander. Jose Vidro ma
 de it a 4-2 game by driving in Carlos Baerga and Jamey Carroll with a do
 uble down the right-field line. Nick Johnson followed and doubled to lef
 t-center field to drive in Vidro and make it a one-run game.\n\nIn the t
 op of the eighth\, Preston Wilson and Baerga became the hitting heroes a
 s the Nationals scored two runs off reliever Ugueth Urbina\, who relied 
 more on his breaking pitches instead of his fastball.\n\nWith a runner o
 n second and one out\, Wilson singled to left to drive in Jose Guillen t
 o tie the score at 4.\n\n\"I think it was a slider he wanted to get more
  down and away and he left it up\,\" Wilson said. \"I was able to sink i
 t through the hole over there.\"\n\nBaerga\, who was subbing for Vinny C
 astilla at third base\, followed and singled to center to drive in Wilso
 n with the go-ahead run. At first\, it looked like second baseman Chase 
 Utley had a shot at catching the ball\, but it went past his glove for a
  base hit.\n\n\"When you get more at-bats in a row\, it's more easy to r
 eact to the pitches\,\" Baerga said. \"You have to know the situation. U
 rbina likes to throw the fastball right away\, but he said [he wasn't go
 ing to throw the fastball]. That's when I knew that he was coming with t
 he changeup. He was out in front with the pitch\, but I managed to hit i
 t to center field.\"\n\nThe winning pitcher was Ayala\, while Urbina too
 k his fourth loss of the season and Cordero earned his 39th save.\n\nThe
  Nationals now travel by bus to New York\, where they will play a three-
 game series against the Mets. Pyschologically\, the two-hour bus ride wi
 ll be to the Big Apple will be pleasant.\n\n\"It's for our own welfare a
 s far as staying in this race. You look at the scoreboard every night\, 
 and you see clubs behind you that are winning and you see clubs in front
  of you that are losing. So you have to start taking advantage of those 
 things\,\" Robinson said. \"This ballgame is a big swing for us. It coul
 d have been a disastrous [trip in Philly]. At least we got away with a s
 plit. It was like a two-game swing in this ballgame tonight.\"\n\nThis s

SUMMARY:(W) @ Chicago
DESCRIPTION:Win: 4-2\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nCHICAGO -- The box s
 core said that Tony Armas Jr. won his fourth game of the season on Satur
 day afternoon against the Cubs at Wrigley Field. But the truth is\, he w
 on this game on June 29\, when pitching coach Randy St. Claire asked Jos
 e Rijo\, the Nationals' special assistant to the general manager\, to ta
 lk to a struggling Armas.\nRijo\, a veteran of 14 big league seasons\, g
 ave Armas words of encouragement\, telling him he was thinking too much 
 on the mound and he was planting his right foot the wrong way after thro
 wing the baseball.\n\n\"Jose is more of a mind games type of guy. He's r
 eally not into mechanics\,\" Armas said. \"He talked to me a lot and he 
 gave me a lot of advice\, he told me everything is there. It's all a min
 d game. He has helped me a lot.\"\n\nThe session worked as Armas was sol
 id for five-plus innings on Saturday\, helping the Nationals defeat the 
 Cubs\, 4-2. The Nationals have now won five consecutive games.\n\nUnlike
  his last two starts\, Armas had command of his pitches. He gave up two 
 runs on six hits\, but the key stat is that he walked just one batter\, 
 while striking out six.\n\nThe right-hander showed how tough he was in t
 he fifth inning. The Cubs had runners on first and third and no outs\, b
 ut Armas managed to prevent the Cubs from scoring. After Cubs starter Je
 rome Williams sacrificed Michael Barrett to second base\, Corey Patterso
 n popped up to Jamey Carroll at short and Neifi Perez grounded out to fi
 rst baseman Wil Cordero to end the inning.\n\n\"I just needed to execute
  my pitches\, that's the main thing\,\" Armas said. \"I just tried to ke
 ep the ball down instead of throwing it up. Every time you are out there
 \, you are learning something new and you have to get out of tough situa
 tions.\"\n\nEven more encouraging\, according to St. Claire\, is that Ar
 mas kept his composure after giving up a triple and home run to Derrek L
 ee in the fourth and sixth innings\, respectively. In his previous outin
 g\, after giving up a home run to Blue Jays second baseman Orlando Hudso
 n\, Armas had a tough time getting hitters out.\n\n\"When he made a mist
 ake\, you didn't see him get frustrated\,\" St. Claire said\, in regards
  to Saturday's effort. \"He gets mad at himself because he is a competit
 or. When he's mad at himself\, it takes him away from what he's trying t
 o do. To Tony's credit\, he stayed within himself and he did a good job.
 \"\n\nSt. Claire also feels that Armas is close to being back to the pit
 cher that was dominating hitters early 2003 before a shoulder injury she
 lved him for most of the past two seasons. Armas' fastball was clocked i
 n the 93\, 94 mph range Saturday.\n\n\"[Armas] is getting back to where 
 he was. Hopefully\, in the second half\, he could be real big. To get hi
 m back to where he was in 2003 would be a tremendous boost for the staff
 .\"\n\nArmas received his run support early in Saturday's game. With two
  outs in the first\, Jose Guillen hit a 1-1 fastball from Williams over 
 the left-field wall for his 17th home run of the season. Sixteen of Guil
 len's homers have come on the road.\n\n\"It was a fastball right down th
 e middle. I have been getting some good pitches to hit on the road. At h
 ome\, it's a different story\,\" Guillen said. \"The wind was blowing in
 \, but I knew it was gone.\"\n\nThe Nationals then played small ball in 
 the fourth inning off Williams. After Guillen singled and Vinny Castilla
  walked\, Marlon Byrd sacrificed the runners over one base before Corder
 o hit a sacrifice fly to right field to score Guillen. Gary Bennett foll
 owed with a single to drive in Castilla.\n\n\"They scrap\,\" Lee said. \
 "They don't have anyone who jumps out at you who's having a huge offensi
 ve year. It seems like they score enough every day to win.\"\n\nIn the b
 ottom of the fourth\, Cubs third baseman Aramis Ramirez made it a two-ru
 n game when he grounded out to shortstop Jamey Carroll\, scoring Lee.\n\
 nThe Nationals made it a three-run game again when Junior Spivey brought
  home Brad Wilkerson with a sacrifice fly to center field in the fifth.\
 n\nThe Cubs scored the last run of the game when Lee homered over the ri
 ght-field wall in the bottom of the sixth inning.\n\nAfter Armas left th
 e game with no outs in the sixth\, the Nationals used four relievers -- 
 Gary Majewski\, Joey Eischen\, Hector Carrasco and Chad Cordero -- to sh
 ut down the Cubs the rest of the way\, with Cordero picking up his Major
  League-leading 29th save.\n\nCordero\, who is on pace to save 60 games 
 this season\, has now converted 26 consecutive opportunities.\n\n\"It's 
 going to end somewhere\, it's just a matter of when\,\" said Cordero of 
 his streak. \"Baseball is a weird game. Anything could happen.\"\n\nThe 
 Nationals\, now 49-31\, increased their lead in the National League East
  to 5 1/2 games over the Braves\, who lost to the Phillies at Citizens B
 ank Park on Saturday afternoon.\n\n\"It's nice to increase your lead bec
 ause you want to put as much distance as you possibly can [from the next
  club]\,\" manager Frank Robinson said. \"Any time you can pick up a bal
 lgame\, that's great.\n\n\"Today was a good day for us\, but we don't wa
 tch the scoreboard. We have to take care of our own business. If we can 
 do that\, even when we are one game ahead\, nobody can catch you. It's n
 ice to put space between other ballclubs.\"\n\nThis story was not subjec

DESCRIPTION:Loss: 3-12\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nCINCINNATI -- Abou
 t 20 minutes after the final out of the Nationals' 12-3 loss to the Reds
  on Wednesday afternoon\, manager Frank Robinson asked the visiting club
 house attendant to turn the music on.\nSuddenly\, rap music could be hea
 rd throughout the clubhouse.\n\nSome of the players were baffled. Usuall
 y\, the Nationals' clubhouse is as quiet as a library after a loss. But 
 it was Robinson's way of telling the players to keep their heads up.\n\n
 \"I don't want the clubhouse to be a morgue\,\" Robinson said. \"I want 
 us to keep our heads up when we are down.\"\n\nVeteran infielder Carlos 
 Baerga\, one of the leaders in the clubhouse\, admitted that he was surp
 rised the music was turned up\, but he understood what Robinson was tryi
 ng to say.\n\n\"Frank is a veteran\,\" Baerga said. \"We got beat by a t
 eam that we were supposed to beat. But stuff like that happens. He doesn
 't want us to keep our head down. The day off is going to be good on Thu
 rsday. We have to forget about this and come back on Friday.\"\n\nThe Na
 tionals were swept by a Reds team that was 5-15 in their previous 20 gam
 es before the three-game series started on Monday. But the Reds played a
 s if they were a reincarnation of the Big Red Machine of the 1970s\, whi
 le the Nationals acted like the 2004 Expos\, which lost 95 games.\n\nThe
  Reds scored 21 runs in the three games and left the Nationals one game 
 over .500 at 24-23.\n\n\"When we are going good\, it's not the manager\,
  it's the players\,\" Robinson said. \"When we are going bad\, it's not 
 the manager\, it's the players. I make out a lineup and hope they perfor
 m. We are not performing at any level or any phase of the game.\"\n\nTha
 t was the case on Wednesday. The Reds took batting practice against four
  Nationals pitchers\, and with the exception of outfielder Jose Guillen\
 , who hit two home runs in the game\, the hitting was virtually nonexist
 ent.\n\nIn fact\, the Nationals were never really in the game as Reds ri
 ght-hander Matt Belisle\, a last-minute replacement for Aaron Harang\, b
 affled them for six innings. Belisle gave up two runs on five hits and f
 anned six.\n\nThe Reds were already up\, 3-0\, when Brendan Harris drove
  in the Nationals' first run on a infield single\, driving in Guillen.\n
 \nIn the sixth\, Guillen cut the Reds' lead to 6-2 with a solo home run 
 to left field.\n\nNationals starter Claudio Vargas just lasted 1 2/3 inn
 ings. In the first\, Felipe Lopez gave the Reds a 2-0 lead by hitting a 
 two-run home run. Vargas was already gone when the Reds scored their thi
 rd run the following inning. With reliever Jon Rauch on the mound\, Ryan
  Freel stole third base and came home on a throwing error by Gary Bennet
 t.\n\nFor Vargas\, it was his third consecutive bad outing. He gave up t
 hree runs -- two earned --- on three hits. After the game\, Robinson sai
 d Vargas lost his spot in the rotation with the spotty performance. John
  Patterson will take Vargas' place once Patterson is taken off the disab
 led list on Tuesday.\n\nAfter the game\, Vargas was spotted talking to J
 ose Rijo\, the special assistant to the general manager. Rijo told Varga
 s that he was aiming his pitches and wasn't being aggressive on the moun
 d.\n\n\"He throws slider\, changeups\, fastball\, and he's throwing them
  at the middle of the plate\,\" Rijo said. \"He has to be more aggressiv
 e. He has to start throwing inside and outside. He is throwing a fastbal
 l in a fastball situation and a slider in a slider situation. You can't 
 fool anybody like that.\"\n\nVargas believes he can handle being in the 
 bullpen. He had a similar role last season with mixed results.\n\n\"If I
  have to go there\, I'm going to try to do my job\,\" Vargas said.\n\nBy
  the fifth\, the Reds put the game away against Rauch. Austin Kearns dou
 bled in two runs\, and Javier Valentin drove in Kearns with a sacrifice 
 fly to center field to make it 6-1.\n\nIn the bottom of the sixth\, Free
 l hit a solo home run against Hector Carrasco before Guillen hit his sec
 ond home run in the top of the eighth.\n\nGuillen went 3-for-4\, but aft
 er the game\, he felt he had let the team down. Guillen pointed out that
  in the first inning he struck out with runners on first and third with 
 one out. He also didn't like the fact that he left nine runners on base 
 during the three-game series.\n\n\"The guys in front of me are getting o
 n base\, and I haven't been able to get it done\,\" Guillen said. \"Trus
 t me\, a lot of people look up to me to get the big hit. It happened yes
 terday\, it happened today. I hit two home runs and it kind of looks OK\
 , but I really want to win. I'm not really playing up to my potential.\"
 \n\nThe Reds added five more runs in the bottom of the eighth off reliev
 er Zach Day\, who made his first appearance since suffering a right wris
 t contusion on Monday.\n\nSeveral times during the inning\, pitching coa
 ch Randy St. Claire and athletic trainer Tim Abraham came to the mound t
 o find out how the wrist was holding up\, and Day insisted that he was O
 K.\n\nThe Nationals now go to St. Louis to face the Cardinals\, who have
  the best record in the National League.\n\nThis story was not subject t

DESCRIPTION:Loss: 0-3\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- On Su
 nday afternoon\, Nationals manager Frank Robinson desperately needed off
 ense. His team has had difficulty scoring runs for weeks.\nSo what did R
 obinson do to kickstart it?\n\nHe sat four starters -- Vinny Castilla\, 
 Jose Vidro\, Brad Wilkerson and Preston Wilson -- and used Matt Cepicky\
 , Jamey Carroll\, Carlos Baerga and Tony Blanco in their places. The Nat
 ionals were still blanked by the Padres\, 3-0\, in front of 36\,440 at R
 obert F. Kennedy Stadium.\n\nThe Nationals have now lost 22 of their las
 t 30 games\, dropping their record to 58-53. However\, they remain 5 1/2
  games behind the Braves in National League East and just two games behi
 nd the Astros in the Wild Card Race.\n\nThe Nationals are now faced with
  a 13-game road trip\, which starts with the Astros on Tuesday. Robinson
  hopes that the bats come around soon. The Nationals are last in the Maj
 or Leagues in batting average\, home runs\, RBIs and runs scored.\n\n\"W
 e are not functioning very well\, offensively\, and I'm concerned about 
 that. No matter what the situation is\, we just can't get anybody to dri
 ve in a run. When you need a big base hit\, you are not getting it\,\" R
 obinson said. \"We are losing ballgames that we should be winning\, and\
 , pretty soon\, it will be too late.\n\n\"If we can get the offense goin
 g\, we can win ballgames. There is still enough time on the schedule.\"\
 n\nWilkerson said the Houston series will determine if the Nationals are
  playoff contenders or pretenders..\n\n\"I think it's a big series for t
 his ballclub to figure out what kind of club it's going to be\,\" Wilker
 son said. \"Is it going to be a club that's going to toughen up and rise
  to the challenge? Or are you going to be a club that's going to collaps
 e?\n\n\"Right now\, it doesn't seem like [we are in] very good spirits. 
 I think this road trip is going to tell a lot about this team. If we can
  regain some momentum and have a good road trip\, I think we'll be OK th
 e rest of the year. It's a huge road trip for us.\"\n\nAs for Sunday's g
 ame\, the Nationals were no match for Padres starter Jake Peavy\, who co
 mpleted his second game of the season. He gave up just five hits while s
 triking out 10 batters and walking two. The only serious threat the Nati
 onals made against Peavy occurred in the third and sixth innings.\n\nIn 
 the third\, they had runners on first and second and no outs\, but start
 er Esteban Loaiza was picked off second base. Cristian Guzman then flied
  out to left field and\, after Nick Johnson walked\, Baerga grounded out
  to end the inning.\n\nIn the sixth\, the Nationals had runners on first
  and third with two outs\, but Cepicky grounded out to first base to end
  the inning.\n\n\"Today\, Peavy didn't make any adjustments. He pitched 
 the same way the entire ballgame. We made no adjustments to try to be su
 ccessful against him\,\" Robinson said. \"It's no matter who we have up 
 there. We put men on base\; we just can't get that hit.\"\n\nCatcher Gar
 y Bennett\, who played with Peavy and the Padres in 2003\, said the righ
 t-hander never tipped his pitches.\n\n\"He does a great job masking his 
 pitches. It looks the same out of his hands until it gets to the plate a
 nd has movement\,\" Bennett said.\n\nLoiaza pitched seven innings\, givi
 ng up three runs on six hits.\n\nThe Padres got on the board in the fift
 h inning when Peavy singled to center field to drive in Khalil Greene.\n
 \nIn the sixth inning\, Eric Young hit a solo home run\, and in the seve
 nth\, Xavier Nady hit a solo shot over the center-field wall to give the
  Padres the 3-0 lead.\n\nOn paper\, it looked like Loiaza had a solid ou
 ting\, but Robinson was not pleased that Loiaza gave up big base hits to
  a pitcher and two position players who do not play on a regular basis.\
 n\n\"Loiaza was OK\, but he has to keep the ball in the ballpark\,\" Rob
 inson said. \"He gave up home runs to two guys. One of them [Young] has 
 70 at-bats\, and the other guy is not a regular ballplayer. And we gave 
 up a base hit to a pitcher at a very crucial time in the ballgame. You j
 ust can't do those things.\n\n\"You look at his numbers\, and you say Lo
 iaza pitched well. It's the results that count now. We can't make those 
 little errors. We have to be almost perfect\, and it's tough to be perfe
 ct.\"\n\nThis story was not subject to the approval of Major League Base

DESCRIPTION:Loss: 3-4\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nMIAMI -- When the N
 ationals were in first place during the first half of the season\, it wa
 sn't like they were a powerhouse on offense. In fact\, they were near th
 e bottom in runs scored and RBIs\, but what helped was that they were al
 ways getting the timely hits and winning most of their games by one run.
 \nGetting that timely hit has not been there during the second half\, an
 d Friday night was no different. The Nationals dropped another one-run g
 ame\, this time to the Marlins\, 4-3\, in front of 29\,322 fans at Dolph
 ins Stadium.\n\nThe Nationals are now on a five-game losing streak and h
 ave lost their last four by one run. They are also 0-7 in one-run games 
 during the second half\, a sharp contrast to the 24-10 mark they had in 
 that category before the All-Star break.\n\nWashington is sinking fast a
 s it fell four games behind Atlanta in the National League East race and
  one game behind Houston in the Wild Card race.\n\nTony Armas Jr. was on
  the mound for the Nationals on Friday and it looked like he wasn't goin
 g to get past the first inning. He threw 34 pitches and gave up three ru
 ns in the frame. The Marlins had the bases loaded with one out when Paul
  Lo Duca doubled to left field to drive in three runs.\n\n\"I tried to s
 low down Lo Duca's bat [with an offspeed pitch]\, but he had a good swin
 g on it\,\" Armas said.\n\nThe way manager Frank Robinson saw it\, the t
 hree-run deficit was hard to overcome because the offense has been strug
 gling to score runs.\n\n\"A pitcher is going to give up some runs someti
 mes\, but the way we are going right now\, you give up three runs in the
  first inning\, we are in a big hole\,\" Robinson said.\n\nArmas\, howev
 er\, would go on to pitch six innings and give up four runs on six hits.
  He struck out only one batter\, but walked four. He ended up throwing 1
 12 pitches\, 60 of them for strikes.\n\n\"He didn't have his command ton
 ight and walks killed him\,\" pitching coach Randy St. Claire said. \"He
  had four walks and two of them scored. But he battled through six innin
 gs and he gave us a chance anyway.\"\n\nThe Nationals pitchers have almo
 st had to be perfect on the mound because of the lack of run support the
 y have received in the second half. But Armas believes that the offense 
 will come around and the team will start winning again.\n\n\"Everybody i
 s trying hard. We are trying to pitch and hit\,\" Armas said. \"Everybod
 y talks about how well we did in the first half. If you look at our box 
 score\, it's always by one run. So\, it's not like we are playing real b
 ad baseball. It's just that things are not going the way we want them to
  go. I have so much confidence in this team. Nobody is pointing fingers 
 at nobody and we are just playing baseball. That's all we want to do.\"\
 n\nMarlins starter Josh Beckett gave up three runs on five hits in 6 1/3
  innings.\n\nNationals catcher Brian Schneider put a run on the board in
  the third inning as he homered over the right-field wall to cut the Mar
 lins' lead to 3-1.\n\nThe Marlins made it a 4-1 game in the fifth inning
  off Armas when Juan Encarnacion blooped a single to left-center field t
 o drive in Miguel Cabrera.\n\nWashington\, however\, made it a close gam
 e in the top of the seventh. With runners on second and third and one ou
 t\, Vinny Castilla singled to left field to send home Jose Guillen.\n\nB
 eckett then left the game in favor of Jim Mecir\, who gave up a single t
 o left field to drive in Preston Wilson.\n\nBut the Nationals couldn't s
 core the rest of the inning as Carlos Baerga\, pinch-hitting for Cristia
 n Guzman\, grounded out to first baseman Jeff Conine\, and pinch-hitter 
 Ryan Church struck out looking on a 2-2 pitch to end the inning.\n\nIt's
  the second time in as any days that Church had a chance to drive in the
  tying run as a pinch-hitter.\n\n\"It was a wasted at-bat\, rally-killer
 . It's getting old. I just get in there and I just killed everything. I 
 don't know what it is\,\" Church said.\n\nChurch refused to make any exc
 uses as to why he has not come through as a pinch-hitter\, but he said i
 t's tough being a pinch-hitter after playing his entire professional car
 eer as a regular.\n\n\"I was telling [bench coach] Eddie Rodriguez today
  that it's one of those things that the role has to change\,\" Church sa
 id. \"I just have to figure it out. Only time will tell.\"\n\nThis story

 h when Chicago tallied four runs off relievers Luis Ayala and Chad Corde
 ro. Ramirez\, who led off the inning\, swung at Ayala's 2-2 pitch and hi
 t his seventh home run of the season.\n\n\"You ask the guy to come in an
 d get three outs\, and [Ayala] didn't do that.\" manager Frank Robinson 
 said. \"You have Ramirez 2-2 and you throw a fastball right down the mid
 dle of the plate\, you are not looking to have much success.\"\n\nAfter 
 the Cubs put runners on first and third with one out\, the Nationals had
  a mental lapse defensively.\n\nWith Jerry Hairston at the plate and Cor
 dero on the mound\, Hairston missed the sign on a squeeze play and Jerom
 y Burnitz was caught in a rundown. But catcher Gary Bennett dropped the 
 throw from third baseman Vinny Castilla and Burnitz scored to make it a 
 4-2 game.\n\n\"I just missed it\,\" Bennett said. \"There's no other way
  to put it. I made a mistake and it hurt us. There's no excuse for that.
  It cost us big time.\"\n\nIt was the first inherited runner that Corder
 o allowed to score in his career. Prior to the game\, he had kept 25 inh
 erited runners from scoring in his first 96 outings.\n\n\"The streak doe
 sn't really matter right now\,\" Cordero said.\n\nBut things got worse f
 or the Nationals. After Hairston walked to put runners on first and seco
 nd\, Todd Hollandsworth struck out. But Corey Patterson hit a slow rolle
 r between the pitcher's mound and first base. Cordero grabbed the ball w
 ith his glove and threw it away\, allowing Jason Dubois and Hairston to 
 score.\n\n\"That's a ball I should have had. I should have called [first
  baseman Nick Johnson] off\,\" Cordero said. \"He probably didn't know i
 f he should stay on the bag or come get the ball. I didn't say anything\
 , so I should have went straight to the bag. It was all my fault.\"\n\nT
 he Nationals battled back in the bottom of the ninth\, but fell a little
  short. With Mike Remlinger on the mound\, pinch-hitter Tony Blanco drov
 e in Bennett with a double down the left-field line. Two batters later\,
  the Nationals had the bases loaded with Todd Wellemeyer on the mound an
 d Jose Guillen as the go-ahead run at the plate.\n\nWith his mother in t
 he stands\, Guillen was confident he was going to hit a game-winning gra
 nd slam. On a 2-0 pitch\, however\, Guillen hit the ball to deep right f
 ield\, but Burnitz caught the ball in front of the wall for the last out
  of the game.\n\n\"That was the best at-bat I had all year\,\" Guillen s
 aid. \"I was really locked in. I look up and I see my mom in the stands.
  I told my teammates I was going to hit the ball out of the ballpark. I 
 don't think I hit it enough\, but I thought I hit it good enough to go o
 ut of the ballpark. You have to remember\, this is a big ballpark and it
  was kind of cold.\"\n\nAyala took his second loss of the season\, while
  reliever Will Ohman won his first game since Aug. 22\, 2000.\n\nEsteban
  Loaiza started for the Nationals and had another solid outing. He laste
 d seven innings and gave up two runs on six hits. Loaiza didn't figure i
 n the decision for the fifth time this season. While he is not frustrate
 d that he has only one victory\, Loaiza said wins are what count when it
  comes to looking for a Major League job.\n\n\"I'm not frustrated. I'm t
 hrowing well\, and everybody knows what I'm doing\,\" Loaiza said. \"But
  at the end of the year\, it's how many wins I have under my belt if I w
 ant to get a job the following year. Hopefully things will change around
  and the team will get the wins.\"\n\nThe Nationals gave Loaiza a 1-0 le
 ad in the second inning when Bennett drove in Castilla with a single to 
 left off Cubs starter Glendon Rusch.\n\nBut the Cubs took the lead in th
 e top of the fourth on RBI singles by Michael Barrett and Dubois. Both h
 its came on the first pitch.\n\n\"They probably knew I was throwing firs
 t-pitch strikes\, and they took advantage of it and they got those two r
 uns\,\" Loaiza said.\n\nThe Nationals tied the score at 2 in the bottom 
 of the sixth inning when Ryan Church singled off reliever LaTroy Hawkins
  to drive in Guillen.\n\nWashington had a chance to pour it on in the si
 xth. It had the bases loaded and one out\, but Hawkins induced pinch-hit
 ter Carlos Baerga to hit into a double play.\n\nThis story was not subje

DESCRIPTION:Win: 5-4\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nPHILADELPHIA -- Jose
  Vidro's solo home run in the top of the 10th inning helped the National
 s edge the Phillies\, 5-4\, in front of 21\,693 at Citizens Bank Park on
  Thursday afternoon.\n\nThe Nationals won their first series and are now
  2-1 to start the season.\n\nWith the score tied at 4\, Vidro took left-
 hander Rheal Cormier's 1-2 pitch over the left-field wall for his first 
 home run of the season. It was his first long ball since Aug. 18 of last
  year against the Giants.\n\n\"I was trying to bunt to get on base becau
 se I saw the third baseman was back\, but it didn't happen\,\" Vidro sai
 d. \"Cormier left the ball out in the middle of the plate. I was able to
  put a good wood on it. I was very happy.\"\n\nOverall\, Vidro drove in 
 three runs in the game.\n\nNationals closer Chad Cordero pitched the fin
 al two innings and won his first game of the season. It's the ninth time
  he has pitched two innings or more since becoming the closer on June 8.
 \n\n\"That was a big game for us to win. It gets us over .500\,\" manage
 r Frank Robinson said. \"We win the first series of the season. That's w
 hat we want to try to do -- win series. If we do that\, we are going to 
 be all right. It's a nice start to the season. It would have been dishea
 rtening if we had lost that ballgame.\"\n\nRight-hander Esteban Loaiza s
 tarted for the Nationals and gave up four runs in 6 2/3 innings. He stru
 ck out four batters and walked three. Loaiza flirted with a perfect game
  until it was broken up by Jim Thome in the fifth inning.\n\nThe Nationa
 ls gave Loaiza a 3-0 lead by the fifth inning against Phillies starter R
 andy Wolf. In the first\, Vidro drove in Brad Wilkerson with a single to
  center field.\n\nIn the fifth\, with runners on first and third and no 
 outs\, Wilkerson singled to right field to drive in Brian Schneider. For
  the game\, Wilkerson went 4-for-5\, a day after he hit for the cycle. I
 n the series\, Wilkerson went 9-for-14 (.643) with a home run and three 
 RBIs.\n\n\"He's off to a tremendous start. He must be seeing the ball ve
 ry well. He is in a good groove with his swing. He is hitting the ball a
 ll over the field\, which is nice. It's tough to defense him\,\" Robinso
 n said. \"I hope he keeps it going and he doesn't let (the media get to 
 his head) and he doesn't read the papers.\"\n\nWilkerson said extra batt
 ing practice is the reason he is off to the best start of his career.\n\
 n\"For the work to pay off\, it feels good. I have to continue to go up 
 there and stay within myself. It feels good to get off to a great start 
 -- for our team and for myself\,\" Wilkerson said.\n\nOne out after Wilk
 erson's RBI single\, Vidro hit a sacrifice fly to center field to bring 
 home Loaiza.\n\nWolf pitched six innings and gave up the three runs on e
 ight hits.\n\nBut the Phillies came back in the bottom of the sixth inni
 ng to tie the score at 3 against Loaiza.\n\nWith one out and Jose Offerm
 an on first base\, Placido Polanco hit a soft liner to center field for 
 a base hit. Wilkerson tried to decoy Offerman into thinking that he was 
 going to catch the ball. However\, the ball went past Wilkerson for an e
 rror. Offerman scored all the way from first base and Polanco stopped at
  second\n\n\"You never know what's going to happen out there. I was just
  thinking about getting people out. I was concentrating on the next hitt
 er\,\" Loaiza said. \"The ball had a good spin and it took off. Other th
 an that\, I was pitching my game and I got a little wild.\"\n\nAfter Bob
 by Abreu walked\, and Jim Thome was hit by a pitch to load the bases\, P
 at Burrell singled up the middle to score Polanco and Abreu.\n\n\"Loaiza
  was fine. It wasn't all his doing either in that sixth inning\,\" Robin
 son said. \"Loaiza was sailing along very nicely. He pitched a tremendou
 s ballgame. He did very well. I'll take that. He looked at home out ther
 e. He moved his pitches around in the strike zone. He kept the hitters o
 ff-balance. He kept us in the ballgame.\"\n\nThe Phillies then took the 
 lead off Loaiza in the bottom of the seventh inning\, when Polanco singl
 ed to left-center field to drive in David Bell.\n\nBut the Nationals tie
 d the score at 4 in the top of the eighth inning off reliever Tim Worrel
 l.\n\nJose Guillen led off with a triple. Nick Johnson then hit a hard g
 rounder that bounced off the first-base bag. Thome managed to get Johnso
 n at first but Guillen scored easily.\n\nThis story was not subject to t

 ght-handed hitters Wednesday. But it didn't work out\, as the Marlins po
 unded the Nationals\, 12-1\, in front of 25\,702 fans at Robert F. Kenne

SUMMARY:(L) vs Cardinals
DESCRIPTION:Loss: 0-6\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- After
  Sunday's game between the Nationals and Cardinals\, Nationals interim g
 eneral manager Jim Bowden was so upset that after he entered the clubhou
 se\, he slammed the door in front of members of the Washington media.\nB
 owden has every reason to be upset. The Nationals were blanked by the Ca
 rdinals\, 6-0\, on Sunday in front of 31\,130 at Robert F. Kennedy Stadi
 um. It was the second day in a row in which Washington was blanked. The 
 last time the Nationals scored was in the fifth inning of Friday's game 
 against the Cardinals.\n\n\"They have to get out of this thing and start
  swinging the bats. Nobody can swing it for them\,\" Bowden said. \"We c
 an't make a trade to change the offense. They know where they are in the
  pennant race. Even though everything is going wrong\, they are still [i
 n it]. But you still have to do it.\n\n\"We gave the Cardinals this game
 . This was embarrassing. We gave them those runs. We let a ball drop\, w
 e didn't do well on a first-to-third steal that Tony [La Russa] put on a
 nd we gave them the game. ... We are giving the bats away. We are swingi
 ng at balls in the zone. We are not swinging at the pitches we should hi
 t and we are giving it away.\"\n\nThis time\, the Cardinals needed five 
 pitchers to get the job done. Cal Eldred\, replacing the injured Mark Mu
 lder\, pitched three-plus innings and gave up no runs on two hits.\n\nIt
  was in the fourth inning in which the Nationals had a chance to score. 
 They had runners on first and second and no outs\, when Eldred was taken
  out of the game in favor of Brad Thompson (2-0).\n\nJose Guillen took i
 t upon himself to sacrifice the runners over\, but Nick Johnson was forc
 ed out at second base. Manager Frank Robinson declined to comment on the
  situation\, but Guillen went into Robinson's office after the game to e
 xplain his move. Robinson didn't like the play\, but\, according to Guil
 len\, Robinson accepted Guillen's explanation.\n\n\"I was trying to do s
 omething. But I came up and bunted to the pitcher. I was trying to move 
 the runners. I was trying to make something happened and it didn't work 
 out\,\" Guillen said. \"Frank never gave me a bunt sign. It makes me loo
 k a little bit stupid. Sometimes it works\, sometimes it doesn't.\"\n\nT
 he move Guillen made left Brad Wilkerson dumbfounded.\n\n\"We are doing 
 things out of the ordinary. Like today\, we have our fourth-place hitter
  at the plate and we are bunting runners over? He's our best hitter on t
 he team right now. We can't do those types of things\,\" Wilkerson said.
  \"When you have your best hitter at the plate\, and you are struggling 
 to score runs\, you need to swing the bat.\"\n\nPreston Wilson was the n
 ext batter and hit into a double play.\n\nLeft-hander John Halama also w
 as an emergency starter for the Nationals\, and he pitched well\, giving
  up two runs in 5 1/3 innings.\n\n\"It was an outstanding performance by
  him and you would think that would inspire us\, but it didn't work\,\" 
 Robinson said.\n\nBoth those runs were scored in the fifth inning. With 
 the bases loaded and reliever Hector Carrasco on the mound\, Yadier Moli
 na hit into a force play at second base\, and David Eckstein scored on t
 he play.\n\nWith two outs\, Jim Edmonds scored the second run of the gam
 e on a double steal to give the Cardinals a 2-0 lead. Molina stole secon
 d and went to third on an error by second baseman Jamey Carroll.\n\nCatc
 her Gary Bennett said he should have held on to the ball and let Molina 
 steal the base uncontested.\n\n\"I should have realized what's going on 
 and not make the throw. It's obviously two outs\,\" Bennett said. \"Moli
 na is not exactly a speed demon. When they took off\, I have to realize 
 that they are trying to steal a run. It was stupid on my part.\"\n\nSo T
 aguchi followed and brought Molina home with a single off the body of Ca
 rrasco.\n\nReliever Mike Stanton was charged with three more runs in the
  top of the eighth inning.\n\nThe Nationals now go to Atlanta to play a 
 crucial four-game series against the Braves. Some of the players on the 
 Nationals said they think the series will determine if their playoff pus
 h will end early.\n\nThe Nationals are now seven games behind the Braves
  in the National League East and three games behind the Phillies in the 
 Wild Card race.\n\n\"It's put up or shut up now\,\" Wilkerson said. \"We
  have to win this series. I don't even think a split or winning one game
  is going to do it.\"\n\nSaid Bennett\, \"If we go in there and play lik
 e we played the last two days\, we are going to be in a world of trouble
 .\"\n\nEven though they can't make a trade to improve the offense\, the 
 Nationals could go to the Minor Leagues for help. However\, it looks lik
 e third baseman Ryan Zimmerman most likely will not join the Nationals u
 ntil Sept. 1\, the date in which rosters expand.\n\nBowden had hoped Zim
 merman would come up before that date\, but injuries to the pitching sta
 ff have prevented Bowden from calling up position players. Instead\, the
  Nationals have been calling up pitchers such as Jason Bergmann\, who ma
 de his Major League debut on Sunday and pitched 1 1/3 innings without gi
 ving up a run. He also struck out two batters.\n\n\"[The players] in the
  locker room know they have three more games before the rosters expand\,
 \" Bowden said. \"They all know by the last game in Atlanta that there i
 s going to be enough choices for Frank that he doesn't have to play any 
 of them\, if he doesn't want to. There's going to be choices everywhere.
 \n\n\"These guys have three days to wake up. We are going to Atlanta wit
 h John Patterson\, Livan Hernandez and Esteban Loaiza on the mound befor
 e the roster expands. Our best guys are going at them\, and you know wha
 t? Be a man\, wake up and do some damage. Or guess what? After that\, Fr
 ank can do what he can do. When we get to Thursday\, and they are not hi
 tting\, you might as well put other people in there. There are a lot of 
 guys that can score no runs a game.\"\n\nThis story was not subject to t

DESCRIPTION:Win: 11-7\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nMIAMI -- Preston Wi
 lson and Nick Johnson drove in a combined nine runs and helped the Natio
 nals pound the Marlins\, 11-7\, in front of 11\,961 at Dolphins Stadium 
 on Wednesday night to sweep the three-game series.\nThe victory means\, 
 at 81-78\, the Nationals are assured of having at least a .500 record fo
 r the season. It's the third year in the last four in which a Frank Robi
 nson-led team will have a record of .500 or better. The Nationals also c
 limbed into third place in the National League East. Going into the firs
 t game of the series against the Marlins\, the Nationals were in last.\n
 \nBut Robinson doesn't want Washington to rest on an even record. The ma
 nager would like his team to be at least six games over .500 when the se
 ason ends on Oct. 2\n\n\"We have three more games to play and we have to
  win those three games\,\" Robinson said. \"That's our goal. Coming to F
 lorida\, we were trying to win three games and avoid being in last place
 . They have a lot of heart and a lot of pride\, and they did not want th
 e good things that they have done this year to slip away.\n\n\"They were
  on a mission to win three ballgames. It's probably the first times this
  year we thought about sweeping a series before we played the first game
 \, and we got it done.\"\n\nThe Marlins gave right-hander Brian Moehler 
 a 1-0 lead after one inning\, but the Nationals took the lead in the thi
 rd inning\, when Johnson hit a two-run homer over the right-field fence.
 \n\nThe Marlins came back and took a 3-2 lead off Nationals starter Este
 ban Loaiza in the bottom of the third inning\, when Miguel Cabrera drove
  in two runs with a single to left field.\n\nBut Washington put the game
  out of reach by the fourth inning. The Nationals scored seven runs in t
 he frame\, highlighted by Johnson's two-run single and Wilson's three-ru
 n homer. Five of those runs were charged to Moehler\, with the other two
  going to reliever Randy Messenger\, who gave up the homer to Wilson.\n\
 nAfter Jeremy Hermida homered off Loaiza to cut the lead to 9-4 in the b
 ottom of the fourth\, the Nationals added to their lead in the sixth inn
 ing\, when Wilson hit a two-run double off Messenger.\n\nWilson now has 
 89 RBIs for the season. His goal is to drive in 90 before the end of the
  season.\n\n\"That would be nice [to reach 90 RBIs]\, but I want to get 
 as many as I can\,\" Wilson said. \"More so than that\, it would mean a 
 lot for me to play on a winning team that had a record better than .500.
  Hopefully\, we'll go home and play well.\"\n\nBoth Johnson and Wilson w
 ere a triple shy of the cycle.\n\n\"You don't get too many chances at it
 \,\" Wilson said. \"It was definitely something that you think about. If
  it was close\, you try to stretch the hit out.\"\n\nLoaiza (12-10) earn
 ed the win despite allowing six runs on 10 hits in six innings. He may h
 ave played his last game in a Nationals uniform. The right-hander and th
 e team have a mutual option\, and it's unlikely Loaiza will accept the d

 llen drove in four runs to help the Nationals pound the Braves\, 11-4\, 
 in front of 19\,093 at Turner Field on Wednesday afternoon.\n\nThe Natio
 nals took two out of three games\, and it's the first time since March 3
 1-April 3\, 2003\, that the Nationals won a regular-season series from t
 he Braves.\n\nManager Frank Robinson didn't want to hear about historica
 l references. He said he was focused on the 2005 season.\n\n\"It's the f
 irst series against the Braves this season and we won the series. That's
  what we focus on when we go into a city --- try to win a series\,\" Rob
 inson said. \"It's nice to win a series against these guys. They have be
 en very tough on us in the past. But we are now focused on 2005.\"\n\nTh
 e Nationals were down\, 3-2\, when they rallied to take the lead in the 
 top of the fifth inning off starter John Thomson (1-1). Jamey Carroll le
 d off with a triple and scored the tying run on a triple by Jose Vidro. 
 It's the first time two Nationals players hit consecutive triples since 
 June 24\, 1999\, when Vladimir Guerrero and Manny Martinez hit back-to-b
 ack triples.\n\nGuillen followed and made it a 4-3 game by hitting a sac
 rifice fly to right field to drive in Vidro. Robinson called it the bigg
 est run of the game.\n\nGuillen added to the Nationals' lead in the top 
 of the seventh by taking Adam Bernero's 1-1 pitch and hitting the ball o
 ver the left-field wall for his fourth home run of the season.\n\nThe Br
 aves made it a 5-4 game in the bottom of the seventh\, when Adam LaRoche
  drove in Chipper Jones with a single to right field off reliever Luis A
 yala.\n\nGuillen went yard again in the ninth inning\, hitting a two-run
  homer off Roman Colon. Guillen now leads the Major Leagues in home runs
  with five.\n\nGuillen downplayed his heroics\, saying that winning is t
 he bottom line.\n\n\"I don't know what to say to you guys. When I put on
  my uniform and cross the white lines\, I'm all about winning\,\" Guille
 n said. \"I going to give the best effort I can give to this team. I'm t
 rying to help this team get better.\"\n\nAfter Guillen's performance on 
 Wednesday\, Robinson said that the Nationals can rely on Guillen to carr
 y the team for a period of time. The Nationals haven't had hat kind of p
 layer since Guerrero was with the Expos.\n\n\"He has this club believing
  that he could get the big hit for us\, he could drive in the big runs\,
 \" Robinson said. \"Everybody just focuses on him when he walks to home 
 plate\, even with nobody on. You feel like he is going to do something s
 pecial.\n\n\"The two home runs will get the headlines\, but what impress
 ed me more than anything else was a sacrifice fly with two strikes. That
  was a professional at-bat right there. He took the ball right where it 
 was pitched and hit it where it was pitched. He didn't try to do too muc
 h with it. He hit the ball and scored the run.\"\n\nGuillen said he is w
 illing to be the person to carry the offensive load.\n\n\"When the oppor
 tunity comes\, I'm going to look for the pitch to hit. I'm an aggressive
  hitter. You guys know the type of hitter I am\,\" Guillen said.\n\nThe 
 Nationals added four more runs in the inning after Colon left the game. 
 With Kevin Gryboski on the mound\, Terrmel Sledge tripled home three run
 s to make it a 10-4 game. The three runs were charged to Tom Martin.\n\n
 Sledge came in to score on a single by Brad Wilkerson.\n\nThe winning pi
 tcher was Tomo Ohka (1-1)\, who pitched six innings and gave up three ru
 ns on four hits. He struck out two batters\, but also offered up six wal
 ks. The last time he walked that many batters was on July 21\, 2001\, wh
 en he was with the Red Sox.\n\nOhka also became the first Nationals star
 ter to get a win in their brief history.\n\n\"He was not good\, but he h
 ung on out there and gave us six innings\,\" Robinson said. \"He was all
  over the place and didn't get into a good grove at any time. He gave up
  only four hits. He kept me on the edge of my seat for six innings\, but
  I'll take it.\"\n\nThe Nationals finished the road trip with a 5-4 reco
 rd against divisional rivals Philadelphia\, Florida and Atlanta\, and he
 ad to Washington to play their first home opener on Thursday.\n\nAlthoug
 h it's early\, the Nationals were happy to go home in a first-place tie 
 with the Braves and Marlins. The Nationals are beginning to believe that
  they can compete in the NL East race.\n\n\"It is early\, but to get fiv
 e wins against the three teams we played is crucial\,\" Wilkerson said. 
 \"You have to take care of your division. If we play well within our div
 ision the whole year\, we have a chance to win the division. To win two 
 out of three against the Braves after a tough first game\, it shows the 
 heart and character of this team.\"\n\nSaid Sledge\, \"We are hungry. We
  are still trying to get a feel for each other\, but now it seems like w
 e're starting to believe that we are real good. From the beginning\, we 
 believed that we were good\, but the results are starting to show.\"\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Loss: 1-2\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nSAN DIEGO -- The Na
 tionals went 4-2 on their current road trip. Not bad\, if the team is in
  last place and 30 games behind the division leader. But\, for the Natio
 nals\, it's a big blow to their Wild Card chances.\nA day after losing a
  heartbreaker on Saturday night\, the Nationals lost another close one t
 o the Padres\, 2-1\, in front of 38\,054 at PETCO Park on Sunday afterno
 on.\n\nThe club finds itself 4 1/2 games behind the Astros with 12 games
  to play.\n\nFor the second consecutive day\, it was the bullpen that co
 uldn't get the job done. The Nationals had a 1-0 lead after seven inning
 s\, but relievers Gary Majewski and Joey Eischen had a tough time findin
 g the strike zone in the eighth and ninth innings\, respectively.\n\nIn 
 the eighth\, with a runner on first and one out\, Majewski walked Brian 
 Giles before hitting Joe Randa on a 1-2 pitch to load the bases. Khalil 
 Greene\, the same hitter who slugged the game-tying grand slam on Saturd
 ay\, hit a sacrifice fly to right fielder Jose Guillen to drive in Eric 
 Young.\n\n\"It's one of those games. I didn't get the job done. The cont
 rol wasn't there where I wanted it\,\" Majewski said.\n\nMajewski said t
 hat his arm is not tired. His 73 appearances puts him in the NL's top 10
 \, and he's never appeared in more than 57 games in his professional car
 eer.\n\n\"Everything is good. I told [Nationals manager Frank Robinson] 
 to put me out there. I want the ball. I'll do the best that I can every 
 time out\,\" Majewski said.\n\nEischen came on and got Xavier Nady to gr
 ound out to end the inning.\n\nBut Eischen's problems started in the nin
 th inning. He gave up a leadoff infield single to Miguel Olivo and follo
 wed that up by hitting Robert Fick with an 0-2 pitch to put runners on f
 irst and second.\n\n\"I hit him in the back with a fastball. I wasn't lo
 oking to hit him in the back. It was supposed to be over the plate\,\" E
 ischen said.\n\nDave Roberts came up and dropped a bunt toward the pitch
 er's mound. Eischen grabbed the ball and threw it passed second baseman 
 Deivi Cruz\, who was covering first\, to allow Olivo to score the winnin
 g run. At first\, it looked like Cruz caught the ball\, but Cruz said it
  hit Roberts and went past him near the right-field foul line.\n\n\"It w
 as a bang-bang play and fortunately it got by him\,\" Roberts said. \"It
  was a big play for us and an opportunity for me to atone for earlier in
  the game\, when I didn't execute in a similar situation. I wanted to pu
 t pressure on him going hard down the line.\"\n\nSaid Eischen: \"The thr
 ow was a little wide. I messed up today\, not the team. They played grea
 t. It was a one-run ballgame.\"\n\nThe Nationals relievers have given up
  10 runs -- nine earned -- in their last six innings. Asked if being ove
 rworked was the reason for their ineffectiveness of late\, Robinson said
 \, \"Those are excuses. If you do have a tired arm\, there is no reason 
 to hit people or walk people. Just put the ball over the plate\"\n\nEste
 ban Loaiza pitched on three days' rest for third time this season and wa
 s solid. The right-hander pitched seven shutout innings and gave up seve
 n hits. He struck out five batters and walked none.\n\n\"I guess I did g
 ood. We battled\, but it's another bad loss\, especially going back home
  with a day off\,\" Loaiza said. \"We have to focus on winning every out
 ing. Losing last night\, now losing today\, it's a little bit of a letdo
 wn. But we have to come back and take Game 1 against the Giants.\"\n\nPa
 dres right-hander Pedro Astacio was just as good\, pitching seven inning
 s and giving up one run on three hits. The Nationals gave Loaiza the ear
 ly 1-0 lead in the second inning\, when Cristian Guzman hit a sacrifice 
 fly to right field to drive in Preston Wilson.\n\nAstacio didn't allow a
 nother hit the rest of the game.\n\n\"[Astacio] is always a guy that cha
 nges speeds. Offspeed stuff gives this ballclub trouble\,\" said Robinso
 n.\n\nThe Nationals had a chance to add to their lead against reliever R
 udy Seanez in the top of the eighth inning. With runners on first and se
 cond and no outs\, the Nats sent pinch-hitter Brandon Watson to the plat
 e. Watson was unable to bunt the runners over and ended up striking out 
 on three pitches.\n\n\"I just didn't execute. There's nothing much I cou
 ld say. I should have gotten the job done\,\" Watson said.\n\nBrad Wilke
 rson then lined out to Fick at first base\, and pinch-hitter Jose Vidro 
 grounded to Seanez to end the inning.\n\nWith 12 games to go\, the Nats 
 skipper refused to give up on the Nationals' playoffs chances\, but he r
 ealizes that the Nationals need help from other teams.\n\n\"We can turn 
 it around if we go out and win some ballgames. We have 12 games left. If
  we win 10 out of 12\, I'll take my chances\,\" Robinson said. \"Natural
 ly\, we need a lot of help. If we win four in a row\, we can get back in
 to the thick of things. We'll see.\"\n\nThis story was not subject to th

DESCRIPTION:Loss: 1-3\n\nBy Bryan Hoch / Special to MLB.com\n\nNEW YORK 
 -- As John Patterson mowed down the Atlanta Braves on Thursday\, sending
  16 straight back to the visiting dugout at RFK Stadium\, it was Nationa
 ls catcher Brian Schneider who enjoyed the best view in the ballpark.\n\
 nChalk that up as somewhat ironic\, since it was none other than Schneid
 er who piped up in Spring Training\, championing the 27-year-old Patters
 on as a candidate for Washington's starting five.\n\nIf Patterson can ke
 ep this form through the season\, Schneider might just have himself a fu
 ture career in scouting.\n\n\"Obviously\, it makes me feel really good\,
 \" said Schneider. \"It only helps the team out. You see certain things 
 in certain guys\, and I just thought he was close to getting it all toge
 ther. He's always had the stuff\; he just needed a chance to show it.\"\
 n\nNow in his second year in this organization\, Patterson wasn't even a
  likely choice to start the year in the Nationals rotation\, but when To
 ny Armas Jr. went down to injury\, it created an opening. Patterson was 
 given the opportunity despite going 0-3 with a 6.88 ERA in three Grapefr
 uit League starts.\n\nIt's just more proof that Spring Training statisti
 cs aren't necessarily indicative of regular season competition\, Patters
 on says. Through five spring appearances\, Patterson has fashioned an 0.
 86 ERA and struck out 17 batters\, best among Nationals starters.\n\n\"I
  think it's that I'm healthy now\,\" Patterson said. \"In years past\, I
 've battled injuries. I feel healthier now\; I feel good. When I go out 
 there\, I know I'm going to do a good job.\"\n\nViewing the right-hander
  from behind the wire bars of his catcher's mask\, Schneider sees a dete
 rmination in Patterson that might not have been there before\, not to me
 ntion a sharper break on his improved slider.\n\nThese days\, Patterson 
 works noticeably more quickly on the mound. He also appears to have no i
 ll effects from the severely strained groin that cost him nearly three m
 onths of the 2004 campaign\, an after-effect of finetuning adjustments h
 e made over the winter.\n\n\"The guy has the same kind of velocity [he d
 id]\, and he knows where it's going\,\" Schneider said. \"He added a lit
 tle better slider this year that has helped a whole lot\, especially wit
 h the curveball he already had.\"\n\n\"All I did was kind of change my r
 elease point a little bit\,\" Patterson said of the slider. \"I'd start 
 it on the plate instead of trying for the corner\, and going to winter b
 all and working on a couple of things down there gave me a good start to
  my season.\"\n\nThat\, and having a clubhouse buddy on his side. Schnei
 der says he never explicitly went to Nationals coaches on the issue of t
 he starting rotation\, simply giving his honest opinion when he was aske
 d by Washington reporters\, but the support was much appreciated by Patt
 erson.\n\n\"I think that's really how this team has been all along\,\" P
 atterson said. \"We all really believe in each other and know what we ca
 n do. Brian's a great catcher\, and we work really well together. I'm gl
 ad we have him.\"\n\nCould've fooled us: After doubling in the ninth inn
 ing off of Mets closer Braden Looper on Friday night\, Washington first 
 baseman Nick Johnson is riding a 12-game hitting streak and has reached 
 base in each of the Nationals' 17 games\, but you couldn't tell it by hi
 s demeanor.\n\nJohnson\, batting .298 after Friday's game\, said before 
 Friday's action that he still isn't quite seeing the ball at the plate\,
  and that the hits that have dropped in are\, for the most part\, just f
 inding holes on their own.\n\n\"I'll be honest -- I haven't been swingin
 g really too good\,\" Johnson said. \"The hits I've gotten aren't too so
 lid. I'll just keep working on my swing and hope to get good pitches to 
 hit. It's been hard to get my swing right.\"\n\nSome love for Castilla's
  glove: Those who watch the Nationals' Vinny Castilla on a daily basis r
 ave about his defense at third base\, and it's not hard to see why. Afte
 r all\, the 37-year-old Castilla has led National League third basemen i
 n fielding two of the last three seasons (2002 and 2004).\n\nWith a litt
 le digging\, the Elias Sports Bureau found even more stunning statistics
  regarding Castilla\, who had played 89 consecutive error-free games ent
 ering Friday night. That placed him 10 shy of tying the all-time record 
 of 99 shared by John Wehner (1992-2000) and Jeff Cirillo (2001-02).\n\nA
 dditionally\, Castilla had handled 271 consecutive chances at the hot co
 rner without committing an error\, stringing together a perfect record s
 ince July 4 of last season. That had already eclipsed the old record of 
 261 set by Milwaukee's Don Money from 1973-74.\n\nIn the sixth on Friday
 \, however\, Castilla committed an error on a Carlos Beltran chopper\, e
 nding his record string of flawless chances at third base at 272.\n\nRen
 ewing acquaintances: The Mets and Nationals continue to share the common
  link of general manager Omar Minaya\, who spent three years calling the
  shots for the Montreal Expos before accepting the same position with th
 e Mets last September.\n\nThe Mets and Nationals saw plenty of each othe
 r through the Grapefruit League schedule\, meeting seven times -- includ
 ing an exhibition game at RFK Stadium on April 3 -- but Minaya said that
  he never gets tired of seeing the club roll into town.\n\n\"It's always
  good to see Frank [Robinson]\,\" Minaya said\, smiling. \"It's good to 
 see the players. There were three years we spent together.\"\n\nOn deck:
  Righthander Tomo Ohka (1-2\, 4.76) is scheduled to head to the hill for
  Washington on Saturday at Shea Stadium\, although his mound opponent ha
 d not yet been determined at gametime on Friday.\n\nLeft-hander Kazuhisa
  Ishii had been schedule against the Nats\, but Ishii was placed on the 
 15-day disabled list Friday with a strain under his left armpit.\n\nPoss
 ible options for New York include Manny Aybar\, who has made 28 Major Le
 ague starts in his career but none since 1999\, and righthander Jae Seo\
 , who hasn't been pitching exceptionally well at Triple-A (8.22 ERA in 1
 5.1 innings) and would have to go on short rest.\n\nThis story was not s

 s Baerga's pinch-hit single helped the Nationals beat the Dodgers\, 6-2\
 , in front of 34\,079 fans at Dodger Stadium on Monday night.\n\nThe vic
 tory was even more amazing considering that the Nationals didn't arrive 
 in Los Angeles until around 5:00 a.m. PT. They arrived so late because t
 hat played a game against the Mets on ESPN on Sunday night.\n\n\"This te
 am shows a lot of heart and desire\,\" manager Frank Robinson said. \"Th
 ey don't seem to let adversity bother them on the field. I didn't have a
 ny idea on how they would react to the trip out here with so little slee
 p. It was a tough trip. It was a tough morning and a tough day. It took 
 them about six inning to shake it off and we came through. I haven't see
 n anything to get this team down yet. I hope's it's that way all year. O
 nce the game starts\, they go about their business.\"\n\nEven though the
  team was tired\, ace Livan Hernandez predicted the Nationals would win 
 the game and score a lot of runs\, according to Baerga.\n\n\"The time si
 tuation hurt a lot\, but Livo and I were talking on the plane. And he sa
 id we are going to win\,\" Baerga said. \"Sometimes\, when you are tired
 \, you play the best game because you concentrate more.\"\n\nThe Nationa
 ls were down\, 1-0\, when they took the lead in the seventh inning off s
 tarter Scott Erickson (1-3). With the bases loaded and no outs\, Cristia
 n Guzman hit into a forceout at second base\, but Ryan Church scored on 
 the play and tied the score at 1.\n\nBaerga\, pinch-hitting for starter 
 Esteban Loaiza and making his first appearance since April 23\, followed
  Guzman\, took a 2-2 pitch and singled to right field to score Vinny Cas
 tilla and give the Nationals a 2-1 lead.\n\nBaerga is hoping that the hi
 t means that Robinson will rely on him more in the late innings.\n\n\"I 
 hit a line drive to right field and that was a turning point in the game
 \,\" Baerga said. \"I need to show this to Frank so he could have confid

  But this is a start. I would like to contribute to this team.\"\n\nThe 
 Nationals then added two runs in the eighth inning off reliever Steve Sc
 hmoll. Both Castilla and Guzman had RBI singles. Jose Guillen then added
  a two-run homer in the ninth off Buddy Carlyle in the ninth.\n\nThe win
 ning pitcher was Loaiza (1-2)\, who won his first National League game s
 ince 1998\, when he was with the Pirates. He was only member of the Nati
 onals who was sent ahead of the team. Loaiza arrived in LA at noon on Su
 nday\, and the rest paid off.\n\nHe had another solid outing\, pitching 
 six innings and giving up one run on three hits. He struck out seven bat
 ters and walked three. Loaiza has now struck 18 batters in his last 14 i
 nnings.\n\nSending Loaiza to LA early \"worked out all right. He threw t
 he ball very well So we can say\, yeah\, we did the right thing\,\" Robi

 both sides of the plate. He's changing speeds. He's getting to the groov

 -- The Nationals needed a strong pitching performance to get out of town
  with a victory\, and Livan Hernandez was more than happy to oblige.\n\n
 Hernandez stepped up and gave Washington its best mound outing of the we
 ekend\, firing seven strong innings on Sunday. Jose Guillen helped out w
 ith three RBIs en route to an 11-4 victory that snapped the Nationals' t
 hree-game losing streak.\n\nIn his last start against the Marlins\, Hern
 andez quibbled with home plate umpire Marvin Hudson's strike zone and ap

 \, on nine hits.\n\nHernandez\, who walked two and struck out three in t
 he effort\, was helped by the Nationals' first big first-inning rally of

DESCRIPTION:Interleague\n\nLoss: 1-8\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nARLI
 NGTON -- Left-hander Kenny Rogers showed why he is the ERA king in the A
 merican League this season as the Rangers defeated the Nationals\, 8-1\,
  in front of 33\,653 at Ameriquest Field on Friday night.\nRogers pitche
 d 6 1/3 innings and gave up one run on eight hits. He struck out three a
 nd walked four. Rogers' ERA went down from 2.02 to 1.98.\n\nThe lone run
  came in the seventh inning\, when Rogers gave up a solo home run to Cri
 stian Guzman.\n\nFor Guzman\, his bat seems to be coming around. He fini
 shed the night 2-for-4 to raise his batting average to .205. During the 
 month of June\, Guzman is hitting .289.\n\n\"I'm trying to come back. I'
 m trying to have my hands ready. I'm having a couple of good swings\,\" 
 Guzman said.\n\nHowever\, most of the Nationals didn't take very good sw
 ings on Friday. In fact\, the Nationals had numerous opportunities to sc
 ore against Rogers. The best ones came in the third and seventh innings.
 \n\nWith Marlon Byrd on first and nobody out in the third\, Nick Johnson
  hit a double over Laynce Nix's head in center. Byrd tried to score on t
 he play\, but he was nailed at the plate. Vinny Castilla grounded out an
 d Wil Cordero flied out to left field to end the inning.\n\nIn the seven
 th\, the Nationals had runners on first and second and one out. Rangers 
 manager Buck Showalter took Rogers out of the game in favor of reliever 
 John Wasdin. Up stepped Castilla\, and\, on the first pitch\, he hit int
 o a double play to end the inning.\n\n\"There's nothing wrong with swing
 ing at the first pitch if it's a good pitch and you can do something wit
 h it\,\" manager Frank Robinson said. \"The only time we notice a person
  swinging at the first pitch is when he is not successful.\"\n\nNational
 s right-hander John Patterson\, on the other hand\, wasn't as effective 
 as Rogers. He lasted five innings and gave up four runs on eight hits. P
 atterson threw 105 pitches and 66 of them were for strikes.\n\nRobinson 
 thought Patterson relied too much on his fastball\, and he didn't have g
 ood command of his breaking ball.\n\n\"He threw a lot of pitches out the
 re. He had over 100 pitches after five innings\,\" Robinson said. \"That
 's too many pitches. If you do that\, you cannot go very far in the game
 .\"\n\nThe Rangers made it a 1-0 game in the second inning when Nix's si
 ngle brought home Alfonso Soriano\, who led off the inning with a double
 .\n\nIn the next inning\, Rangers third baseman Hank Blalock made it 2-0
  by hitting his 12th home run of the season. Patterson said he threw the
  ball to a good location\, but Blalock managed to hit to out.\n\n\"We ha
 d been working lefties in a lot all night. He was looking for one pitch\
 ,\" Patterson said. \"I made the pitch in the location that I wanted and
  that's what he was looking for.\"\n\nThe Rangers scored two more runs i
 n the fifth inning. Blalock drove in Michael Young with a single to righ
 t\, while Soriano drove in Mark Teixeira with a sacrifice fly to left fi
 eld.\n\nPatterson\, a Texas native\, admitted that the heat was getting 
 to him by the third inning. He was constantly using the rosin bag to dry
  his sweaty hands. It was 93 degrees at game time.\n\n\"I'd kind of forg
 otten what it's like during the summer. It's hard to breathe and it's ha
 rd to grip the balls. I hardly ever use rosin\,\" Patterson said.\n\nIt 
 also didn't help that he had to battle early in the game. For example\, 
 in the first inning\, he threw 11 pitches to Teixeira before getting him
  to fly out to right field on the 12th pitch.\n\n\"It sets a completely 
 different tempo and pace for the game\,\" Patterson said of the tough st
 art. \"I go through two or three broken bats in those first couple innin
 gs and I had runners on the whole time. I threw a lot of pitches in that

 n\nThe Rangers batted around in the eighth and scored four runs off reli
 evers T.J. Tucker and Gary Majewski.\n\nKevin Mench started things off b
 y hitting his 12th home run of the season off Tucker.\n\nThere were runn
 ers on first and second and one out\, when Tucker had to leave the game 
 because of a hyperextended elbow. Majewski entered and struck out David 
 Dellucci. But then Majewski gave up RBI singles to Young\, Teixeira and 
 Blalock.\n\nRobinson really didn't want to use Majewski in the game beca
 use the skipper felt that the right-hander was tired. Robinson said Maje
 wski will have the day off on Saturday\, and with Tucker out of action f
 or at least three games\, the Nationals will be short two relievers agai

 on his mind. His grandfather\, Bruno Majewski\, is having heart problems
  and will have an angioplasty a week from Friday.\n\n\"I just showed up 
 to the field and it's just one of those days that I pitched. I wasn't re

SUMMARY:(W) vs Braves
DESCRIPTION:Win: 5-4\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- The Na
 tionals came back from a 3-0 deficit to defeat the Braves\, 5-4\, in fro
 nt of 29\,512 fans at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium on Tuesday night.\nThe N
 ationals have won three consecutive games and are only 1 1/2 games behin
 d the Braves and Marlins in the National League East. All this despite h
 aving 11 players on the disabled list.\n\n\"The schedule has kind of bee
 n good to us on the road\,\" manager Frank Robinson said. \"The right te
 ams won. Things broke right for us when we were struggling. Now we are w
 inning and playing the right teams in the division. We are also getting 
 help from other teams that are beating the frontrunners. That's good.\"\
 n\nThe Nationals started their rally in the bottom of the sixth inning o
 ff reliever Adam Bernero. With the bases loaded and no outs\, Marlon Byr
 d hit into a double play\, but Jose Guillen scored on the play.\n\nBacku
 p catcher Gary Bennett followed and made it a 3-2 game by hitting a sing
 le to left to score Nick Johnson.\n\n\"My job is behind the plate when B
 rian [Schneider] needs a day off\, but everybody wants to hit\,\" said B
 ennett who is hitting .250 with eight RBIs this season. \"That was fun t
 onight.\"\n\nIn the bottom of the seventh inning\, the Nationals scored 
 the go-ahead runs off three different pitchers. They first caught a brea
 k before the rally started. With Ryan Church at first and no outs\, Brad
  Wilkerson hit what looked like a perfect double play ball to second bas
 eman Marcus Giles. But Giles bobbled the ball and could only throw Wilke
 rson out at first base.\n\n\"It was a tough play\,\" Wilkerson said. \"I
  hit the ball right on the nose. It was hit right at him. I saw the bad 
 hop and I said\, 'Thank goodness.'\"\n\nAfter Jamey Carroll singled to p
 ut runners on first and third\, Guillen singled to left off Kevin Grybos
 ki to drive in Church. The run was charged to Roman Colon.\n\nIn his las
 t two games\, Guillen is 5-for-8 with three RBIs. He said that he is beg
 inning to feel comfortable at the plate.\n\n\"The hit gives me a lot mor
 e confidence\,\" Guillen said. \"The last few games I have been leaving 
 a lot of runners on base\, especially in those situations.\"\n\nCarroll 
 and Guillen both scored when Nick Johnson took a John Foster pitch and d
 oubled near the right-field line to make it a 5-3 game.\n\nBut the Brave
 s made it close in the ninth off closer Chad Cordero. Julio Franco made 
 it a 5-4 game by hitting a home run over the fence in right-center field
 .\n\nAndruw Jones and Johnny Estrada followed with consecutive singles. 
 After Brian Jordan hit into a force play to put runners on first and thi
 rd\, Cordero picked up some speed on his fastball and struck out Brayan 
 Pena and Rafael Furcal to end the game.\n\n\"My heart was racing. Once F
 ranco hit the home run\, I said\, 'Not again\,'\" said Cordero\, who als
 o gave up a ninth-inning home run to Andruw Jones on Monday. \"I was ner
 vous\, but I was able to control myself and managed to get out it.\"\n\n
 The winning pitcher was reliever Luis Ayala\, while Colon took the loss.
  Cordero picked up his 13th save of the season.\n\n\"We have been battli
 ng hard\,\" Wilkerson said. \"We have been fighting a lot of injuries. T
 o be where we are\, we are very happy. I think our best baseball is ahea
 d of us. The last two nights we have played really good baseball. We hav
 e to continue to do that.\"\n\nNationals right-hander John Patterson and
  Braves left-hander Mike Hampton started Tuesday's game\, but didn't fig
 ure in the decision. Both pitchers were coming off the disabled list\, a
 nd both pitched well.\n\nHampton pitched four shutout innings\, while Pa
 tterson pitched five innings and gave up the one run on one hit. Patters
 on felt he could have pitched longer\, but the Nationals had him on a 75
 -pitch limit. Patterson also said his back\, which had given him problem
 s the last couple of weeks\, is fine.\n\n\"I struggled in the first inni
 ng with my command\,\" Patterson said. \"After that\, I felt I had good 
 tempo. I just got out there and threw the ball and stayed ahead of the h

DTEND;TZID=US/Central:20050715T220000
DESCRIPTION:Loss: 3-4\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nMILWAUKEE -- It was
  a weird night for reliever Mike Stanton\, who was making his Nationals 
 debut. Before he even threw a pitch on Friday night\, first base umpire 
 Paul Schrieber called a balk in the 10th inning with a runner on third b
 ase\, giving the Brewers a 4-3 win in front of 40\,690 at Miller Park.\n
 With runners on first and third and Lyle Overbay at the plate\, it looke
 d like Stanton had Rickie Weeks picked off\, but Schrieber called a balk
 \, which allowed Chris Magruder to score the winning run.\n\nSchrieber c
 alled the balk because he saw Stanton's body going toward home plate as 
 he was throwing to first base.\n\n\"It was just real simple\,\" Schriebe
 r said. \"I had his body going toward the plate and throwing to first.\"
 \n\nAsked if Stanton's right foot stepped toward first base\, Schrieber 
 said\, \"Well\, there's more to it than that. Yes\, he does have to step
  toward first\, or if he steps toward the plate\, that would be a balk.\
 "\n\nManager Frank Robinson had the media gather around the video equipm
 ent to determine if Stanton balked. Robinson showed a still shot of the 
 play and then a replay in its entirety.\n\nBoth shots showed that Stanto
 n's body was going toward first base as he was trying to pick off Weeks.
  The replay showed that only Stanton's face was looking at home plate. R
 obinson felt that Schrieber was reacting to the Brewers\, who were compl
 aining that Livan Hernandez had balked when he picked off Trent Durringt
 on in the seventh inning.\n\n\"Unless home plate is down the first-base 
 line\, there no way he stepped toward home\,\" Robinson said. \"His foot
  is toward the ground toward first base. He can't do anything else. This
  game shouldn't have ended like that.\n\n\"How in the world do they thin
 k that a guy as experienced as Mike Stanton will come into that situatio
 n and fool around with some kind of balk move. That's the move he has be
 en using for years. Why would he come into a ballgame and see a differen
 t type of move?\n\n\"We are battling for our lives here. And also\, we h
 aven't gotten started in the win column in the second half of the season
 . And we are battling in a ballgame and it was taken away from us. We we
 ren't given a chance to compete.\"\n\nThe balk was Stanton's eighth of h
 is career and his first since 2003\, when he was with the Mets. Stanton 
 said he has made the pickoff move to first base for years. In fact\, Sta
 nton said that home plate umpire Bob Davidson didn't see Stanton make th
 e move toward home plate.\n\n\"[Davidson] asked me what I did\,\" said S
 tanton\, who signed with the Nationals last Thursday. \"If I stepped to 
 the plate\, I would think he would be the one to see the balk. Typically
 \, the first base umpire makes balk calls as we cross the rubber. It's u
 nfortunate that it had to end that way\, but what can you do? You have t
 o shake it off and move on.\"\n\nThe balk call may have been the backbre
 aker for the Nationals\, but they had numerous chances to win the game b
 efore they went into extra innings.\n\nIn the seventh inning\, with the 
 Nationals leading\, 3-2\, they had runners on first and third with one o
 ut\, but Jose Guillen hit into a double play to end the inning.\n\nThe n
 ext frame\, third base coach Mike Huppert made a questionable decision. 
 With Preston Wilson on third base\, Vinny Castilla hit a short fly ball 
 to right fielder Geoff Jenkins\, who nailed Wilson at the plate.\n\nA te
 am source said that Wilson should have stayed put at third because Brian
  Schneider\, not Hernandez\, was the next hitter.\n\n\"We were in a posi
 tion to add to our lead and we didn't take advantage of it in the sevent
 h or eighth inning\,\" first baseman Brad Wilkerson said. \"You have to 
 take advantage of those opportunities and not put too much pressure on o
 urselves.\"\n\nThe winning pitcher was Julio Santana\, while Luis Ayala 
 took the loss.\n\nIt looked like Hernandez wasn't going to last the firs
 t inning. He twisted his right ankle slipping on the mound\, but he went
  on to pitch eight solid innings and gave up three runs on nine hits. He
  struck out seven batters and walked two.\n\nThe Nationals were able to 
 give Hernandez an early lead with Ben Sheets on the mound for Milwaukee.
  In the top of the first inning\, Wilkerson led off the inning by taking
  Sheets' 1-0 pitch and hitting the ball over the right-field wall for hi
 s sixth home run of the season.\n\nWith two outs in the same inning\, Ry
 an Church singled to right field to drive in Jose Vidro.\n\nBut the Brew
 ers quickly came back with two runs of their own off Hernandez in the bo
 ttom of the first. Overbay doubled to drive in Weeks and Jenkins drove i
 n Overbay with a sacrifice fly.\n\nThe Nationals were able to take the l
 ead in the top of the fifth inning. With the score tied at 2 and Sheets 
 still on the mound\, Wilson doubled down the third-base line to drive in
  Vidro.\n\nBut the Brewers tied the score again when Carlos Lee took Her
 nandez's 1-2 pitched and turned it into his 23rd home run of the season.
 \n\nThe Nationals have now lost four games in a row. They are still in f
 irst place in the National League East\, but are just 1 1/2 games in fro
 nt of the Braves. Wilkerson said there is no time to push the panic butt
 on.\n\n\"I think we have to go about our business and have fun and see w
 hat happens\,\" Wilkerson said. \"We have nothing to lose. If we happen 
 to be there\, we'll be there. We'll leave it on the field.\"\n\nThis sto

DESCRIPTION:Loss: 2-8\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- Brewe
 rs right-hander Wes Obermueller pitched eight solid innings as the Brewe
 rs defeated the Nationals\, 8-2\, in front of 26\,427 fans at Robert F. 
 Kennedy Stadium on Tuesday night.\nObermueller\, who had a 3.72 ERA ente
 ring the game and was 8-15 with an ERA over 5.00 during his career\, ret
 ired the first 19 batters he faced before Jamey Carroll singled to right
  field on a 1-2 pitch in the seventh inning.\n\n\"Obermueller just moved
  the ball in and out\,\" Carroll said. \"We hit some balls that were goi
 ng right at people. It seems like we were hitting the ball hard here and
  there. Sooner or later\, we were going to get to him\, but we didn't ge
 t a hit until the seventh.\n\n\"Obviously we felt we should have collect
 ed some hits earlier. It's just the game of baseball tonight. They got t
 he big lead early and they just kind of rolled from there.\"\n\nNick Joh
 nson followed with another single\, but the Nationals didn't do any dama
 ge against Obermueller after that.\n\nOverall\, Obermueller gave up two 
 hits\, struck out four batters and walked none.\n\n\"Tonight was one of 
 those nights where if they make contact\, the defense was going to pick 
 me up\,\" Obermueller said.\n\nObermueller's performance didn't surprise
  Nationals backup catcher Gary Bennett. Bennett played for the Brewers l
 ast year and he pointed out that Obermueller had similar performances ag
 ainst the Giants and Astros last year.\n\nBefore Tuesday's game\, Bennet
 t told his teammates that if Obermueller had problems with his breaking 
 ball\, he was going to throw nothing but fastballs throughout the game. 
 As it turns out\, Obermueller didn't have any problems with his pitches.
 \n\n\"He has good stuff. He's going to continue to get better\,\" Bennet
 t said. \"He has a live fastball\, he has a good sinker and his fastball
  will cut at times. He has a slider and curveball. If he's able to throw
  all those for strikes\, he's very tough.\"\n\nThe Brewers\, on the othe
 r hand\, did plenty of damage against right-hander Claudio Vargas\, who 
 lasted 1 2/3 innings and gave up six runs on seven hits.\n\nIn the first
  inning\, Brady Clark led off with a home run and\, later in the inning\
 , Lyle Overbay drove in Geoff Jenkins with a double to right field.\n\nI
 n the second\, the Brewers scored four runs\, highlighted by Carlos Lee'
 s three-run home run.\n\nVargas' outing was the antitheses of the one he
  had in Arizona\, in which he pitched six shutout innings against the Di
 amondbacks. Vargas said he had problems with his breaking pitches and ha
 d to rely too much on the fastball.\n\n\"I missed a lot of pitches up in
  the zone\,\" Vargas said. \"That happened a lot for me last year. It wa
 s just a bad day. They swung at everything and they hit it.\"\n\nThe onl
 y good news for the Nationals came from right-hander Tomo Ohka\, who rep
 laced Vargas in the second inning. Ohka pitched 5 2/3 innings and gave u
 p no runs on two hits. It was Ohka's first appearance since May 6 agains
 t the Giants. Prior to the Tuesday's game\, Ohka had serious problems th
 rowing strikes.\n\n\"He was in the strike zone and getting ahead of hitt
 ers and he was working a little faster\,\" manager Frank Robinson said. 
 \"Hopefully\, next time\, it will be a carryover. After the first couple
  of hitters\, he was able to get himself adjusted on the mound. He threw
  the ball the way he's capable of throwing.\"\n\nDuring his inactivity\,
  Ohka was able to stay sharp by having bullpen sessions and playing catc
 h on flat ground. However\, Ohka's good outing does not mean that he wil
 l be back in the rotation quickly.\n\n\"You don't jump back [in the rota
 tion] that quickly\, but that's a step in the right direction\,\" Robins
 on said. \"You certainly file that away. That should be good for him. I 
 think he could take an awful lot from tonight's game -- mentally. ... If
  he continues to be successful\, it will put a lot of pressure on us to 
 find a spot for him in the rotation.\"`\n\nRight-hander Zach Day continu
 es to struggle on the mound. He gave up two runs in the ninth inning on 
 a sacrifice fly to Lee\, who ended up driving in four runs\, and an RBI 
 groundout to Damian Miller.\n\nThe Nationals scored their two runs in th
 e ninth inning\, when Johnson hit a two-run home run off reliever Ricky 
 Bottalico.\n\nThis story was not subject to the approval of Major League

DESCRIPTION:Loss: 2-3\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- The N
 ationals could find themselves in serious trouble. After they were edged
  by the Rockies\, 3-2\, in front of 32\,381 at RFK Stadium on Wednesday 
 night\, right-hander Livan Hernandez revealed that he could be lost for 
 the season in more ways than one.\nHernandez said that he is 99 percent 
 sure that he will have season-ending surgery on his right knee\, which h
 as been bothering him since mid-May. He also expressed anger at some asp
 ect of the Nationals organization\, preferring to keep his thoughts to h
 imself for the time being.\n\n\"There is no decision right now. I'm goin
 g to make it tomorrow\,\" said Hernandez. \"I'm going to sleep tonight. 
 I'm going to think about it\, and we'll see. I'm not going to have any m
 ore MRIs. I'm not going to do nothing. I'm going to go straight to the p
 oint and that's it. It's only one percent that I will not [have surgery]
 . It's not easy to make that decision. I love this team. You know I neve
 r quit.\"\n\nBoth interim general manager Jim Bowden and manager Frank R
 obinson were caught off-guard when told what Hernandez said about the se
 ason-ending surgery. In fact\, Bowden said that he is usually told immed
 iately about injuries and operations.\n\n\"As far as we are concerned\, 
 the knee hasn't gotten any worse\,\" said Robinson. \"I'm not going to c
 omment [on Hernandez having surgery] because I didn't hear it. He chose 
 to talk to [the media] about it.\"\n\nHernandez being unhappy with the N
 ationals comes as a complete surprise. He has often expressed how much h
 e has enjoyed playing for the organization. In fact\, he said that the 2
 003 season\, his first year with the Expos\, was his happiest in basebal
 l -- this from a player who was the World Series MVP in 1997 with the Ma
 rlins and a Fall Classic participant with the Giants in 2002. He often t
 alked about how the Nationals/Expos have left him alone and allowed him 
 to pitch in peace.\n\nRegarding his anger\, Hernandez said\, \"I've been
  happy [with this franchise] for three years. This is the best organizat
 ion. After the season\, I'm going to tell you something. Don't worry\, I
 'm going to tell you.\"\n\nHernandez pitched in Wednesday's game against
  the Rockies and didn't appear to be in any serious pain. He gave up thr
 ee runs in seven innings en route to losing his fourth game of the seaso
 n. He also set a franchise record by hitting four batters in a game. Her
 nandez said that he lost control of his slider.\n\n\"The slider was runn
 ing inside too much. The hitters think it was a fastball\, and they were
  moving in too quick. I hit four people\, and that has never happened to
  me before\,\" he said.\n\nHernandez gave up the game-winning home run i
 n the top of the sixth inning.\n\nGoing into that inning\, the Nationals
  had a 2-1 lead\, but that evaporated quickly. After Desi Relaford was h
 it by a pitch with no outs\, catcher JD Closser followed and hit Hernand
 ez's 1-1 fastball over the right-field wall for a two-run homer to give 
 the Rockies the 3-2 lead.\n\n\"I pitched good. The guy hit a good pitch 
 and hit a home run. It wasn't a bad pitch\,\" said Hernandez. \"The ball
  was inside\, and the guy was looking for that pitch\, and he hit it goo
 d.\"\n\nIt's the fourth consecutive series in which the Nationals lost t
 o a mediocre team -- the Mets\, the Phillies\, the Brewers and\, now\, t
 he Rockies.\n\nThe Nationals have now lost 10 out of their last 14 games
  and seen their lead over the Braves in the National League East dwindle
  to a half-game.\n\nThe winning pitcher was Jason Jennings\, who pitched
  five innings and gave up two runs on four hits.\n\nThe Nationals had a 
 chance to break it open in the first inning\, but they only scored one r
 un. With no outs\, Jose Vidro gave the Nationals a 1-0 lead when he doub
 led to score Jamey Carroll. Unfortunately\, Vidro was thrown out trying 
 to go to third base on the play.\n\nThe next hitter\, Brad Wilkerson\, s

DESCRIPTION:Loss: 2-4\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nLOS ANGELES -- Jaso
 n Phillips' two-run double in the bottom of the fifth inning helped the 
 Dodgers defeat the Nationals\, 4-2\, in front of 41\,190 fans at Dodger 
 Stadium on Tuesday night.\nWith the score tied at 2\, runners on first a
 nd second and two outs\, Phillips took Jon Rauch's 0-1 pitch down the th
 ird-base line for a double that scored Ricky Ledee and Jose Valentin.\n\
 nThe game had its share of whacky moments. The Nationals made several ba
 serunning blunders\, Washington third base coach Dave Huppert made a que
 stionable decision and tension surfaced between pitcher Zach Day and man
 ager Frank Robinson.\n\nThe first baserunning gaffe occurred in the four
 th inning. With one out and Jose Guillen on second base\, Vinny Castilla
  hit a grounder to third baseman Jose Valentin\, who then tagged out Gui
 llen for the second out.\n\n\"Those are things we can't afford to do -- 
 running to an out\,\" Robinson said.\n\nBut the biggest blow came in the
  seventh inning.\n\nThe Nationals had a golden opportunity to tie the sc
 ore off three different Dodgers pitchers.\n\nStarter Jeff Weaver left th
 e game after giving up a leadoff walk to Brian Schneider. After Cristian
  Guzman singled off reliever Duaner Sanchez\, extending his hitting stre
 ak to 11 games\, to put runners on first and second\, pinch-hitter Carlo
 s Baerga singled to center field.\n\nDodgers center fielder Milton Bradl
 ey didn't run hard after the ball and didn't throw the ball hard to seco
 nd base.\n\nSchneider should have easily scored on the play\, but he got
  a late jump to third after Baerga hit the ball. Huppert stopped him at 
 the last second after Schneider rounded third base. Schneider still coul
 d have scored because of the way Bradley played the ball.\n\n\"I saw tha
 t Schneider hesitated there\, and he said he didn't get a good jump\,\" 
 Huppert said. \"He said he was turning around to see if the ball was goi
 ng to fall. With us being down by two runs\, I didn't want to take the c
 hance with the top of the order coming up and nobody out.\"\n\nSchneider
  said he was not going to second-guess Huppert's decision to leave him a
 t third base.\n\n\"My back was to the play and I just tried to get the b
 est read I could off Baerga's bat. That was the heat of the moment play\
 ,\" Schneider said.\n\nTo make matters worse\, Guzman\, thinking that Sc
 hneider had scored\, then found himself hung up between second and third
  and was tagged out.\n\n\"[Guzman] has to understand that he has to run 
 with his head up\, because he didn't know what the coach was going to do
  with the runner\,\" Robinson said.\n\nLeft-hander Kelly Wunsch was brou
 ght in\, and he struck out Brad Wilkerson and got Nick Johnson to fly ou
 t to left field.\n\nDay pitched just 3 2/3 innings\, giving up two runs 
 on six hits. He did not figure in the decision.\n\nDay was given a 2-0 l
 ead after three innings\, thanks to an RBI single by Ryan Church and an 
 RBI double by Johnson. But Day gave up RBI singles to Valentin and Hee-S
 eop Choi in the fourth inning.\n\nRobinson didn't give Day the chance to
  finish the inning\, taking the right-hander out of the game with an out
  to go. Robinson said he didn't want the game to get out of hand.\n\n\"H
 e was in trouble every inning\,\" Robinson said of Day. \"The Dodgers hi
 t the ball hard in the fourth inning against him. It puts a strain on th
 e bullpen. That's the whole thing about it.\"\n\nThe Nationals\, who hav
 e only 10 pitchers on the active roster\, used two relievers on Tuesday\
 , with Rauch giving up the two runs in 2 1/3 innings.\n\nThis is not the
  first time Robinson showed a lack of confidence in Day. On April 25\, D
 ay was taken out of the game after being behind in the count\, 2-0\, to 
 Phillies pitcher Cory Lidle.\n\nOn Tuesday\, things got testy between Da
 y and Robinson. As the skipper came out of the dugout and walked toward 
 the pitcher's mound\, Day had his back turned toward Robinson. Day hande
 d him the ball with his back turned\, then walked toward the dugout with
 out looking at Robinson.\n\nRobinson didn't want to talk about the situa
 tion\, but a source said that Day showed up Robinson.\n\nDay was asked a
 bout disrespecting his manager\, and he said he did nothing of the sort.
 \n\n\"I was battling. It was his decision\, but I wasn't showing Frank u
 p or anything like that\,\" Day said. \"I was talking to Schneider. I wa
 nt to be out there and I want to have somebody that is confident in what
  I can do. That will help me out personally.\"\n\nDay will have to get h
 is confidence back as a reliever. When Tony Armas Jr. is activated from 
 the disabled list early next week\, Day will be in the bullpen.\n\nAsked
  what he thought his future was with the Nationals\, Day said\, \"I don'
 t know. I wish I could tell you. It has been tough. I know Frank has had
  a short leash on me. Maybe I'm putting a little bit more pressure on my
 self. I'm going to work through it. I have confidence in my stuff. It's 
 tough knowing you give up a walk or a base hit and you are putting the p
 ressure on the bullpen.\"\n\nThis story was not subject to the approval

DESCRIPTION:Loss: 3-4\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nCINCINNATI -- Randy
  Keisler's one-out single in the bottom of the 14th inning helped the Re
 ds defeat Nationals\, 4-3\, in front of 36\,539 at Great American Ball P
 ark on Tuesday night.\nWith runners on second and third\, the infield dr
 awn in and Luis Ayala on the mound\, Keisler\, a left-handed reliever\, 
 helped his own cause by hitting a soft grounder past the diving Jamey Ca
 rroll to score Jason LaRue. It was Keisler's first Major League hit and 
 RBI of his career. He was 0-for-4 prior to the at-bat.\n\nBefore Keisler
  came to the plate\, Reds third baseman Ryan Freel made him feel comfort
 able.\n\n\"Freel had me so excited\,\" Keisler said. \"He said\, 'You ha
 ve nothing to lose. Let's go out there and swing it.' And I was so excit
 ed\, I swung at the first pitch\, and it was two feet off the plate. Luc
 kily the infield was drawn in\, and I got enough wood on [the next pitch
 ]. That's exciting. I always wanted to be part of something like that. I
 t was real fun.\"\n\nThe game was not fun for the Nationals\, who have n
 ow lost four out of the their last five games. They left 17 runners on b
 ase and were 3-for-17 with runners in scoring position.\n\n\"It has been
  no more frustrating than it has been over the last few ballgames\,\" Ma
 nager Frank Robinson said. \"These are ballgames we were winning\, and n
 ow we can't buy a hit [with runners in scoring position]. I don't care w
 ho's up there.\n\n\"We squandered too many opportunities during the cour
 se of the ballgame. We can't seem to get the big hits. We can't put anyt
 hing together. That's what happens\, especially when you are on the road
  and the other team has the last at-bat. Until we start hitting with run
 ners on base\, it's going to be a dog fight.\"\n\nRight-hander Livan Her
 nandez started for the Nationals and pitched seven solid inning. He gave
  up the three runs on six hits. He struck out eight batters and walked t
 hree. But it was the first inning that proved costly for Hernandez.\n\nW
 ith the bases loaded\, Austin Kearns doubled down the right-field line t
 o score Felipe Lopez\, Sean Casey and Adam Dunn and make it a 3-1 game.\
 n\n\"Livan wasn't as sharp as he had been. But you can't ask anything mo
 re from the pitchers. They have done the job for us\,\" Robinson said.\n
 \nHernandez said he didn't have any problem with his right knee\, which 
 was inflamed last week. He was able to run the bases without any pain. H
 ernandez was also happy that he was able to regroup after the first inni
 ng and didn't allow the Reds to score any more runs.\n\n\"The first inni
 ng was a bad inning\,\" Hernandez said. \"The pitch I threw [to Kearns] 
 was in the middle of the plate and he hit the ball late to right field. 
 He was looking for a breaking ball.\"\n\nThe Nationals had a golden oppo
 rtunity to make it a one-run game in the third inning off Reds starter B
 randon Claussen. After Carroll doubled with one out\, Nick Johnson follo
 wed with a single to center. It looked like Carroll could have scored ea
 sily on the play\, but third-base coach Dave Huppert held Carroll at thi
 rd base\, while Ken Griffey Jr.'s throw went wide left of home plate.\n\
 nJose Guillen was the next hitter\, and Carroll said he should have scor
 ed after Guillen hit a slow ground ball to Freel at third base for the s
 econd out of the inning.\n\n\"Looking back\, I should have scored. I saw
  the ball hit in front of me and I froze and it was too late. It was a r
 eaction play and you have to read it\,\" Carroll said.\n\nThe Nationals 
 would eventually score their second run in the fifth inning off Claussen
 . Marlon Byrd\, pinch-hitting for Ryan Church\, drove in Johnson with a 
 sacrifice fly to right field.\n\nBut the Nationals tied the score in the
  bottom of the ninth inning\, when Carlos Baerga\, pinch-hitting for Cri
 stian Guzman\, singled down the first-base line off reliever David Weath
 ers to drive in Johnson.\n\n\"It seems like we were one hit away\, \"Bae
 rga said. \"We had a lot of guys on base. We know that we had the opport
 unity to win the game. We have to come back tomorrow and win this game a
 nd have a good day off\, because we need it.\"\n\nThe Nationals are now 
 12-14 on the road and are beginning to play like the Expos teams that lo
 st a combined 100 games when they didn't have the last at-bat the last t
 wo years. However\, Brian Schneider believes the Nationals will play bet
 ter on the road.\n\n\"I'm not saying this as a copout\, but it's a new y
 ear and a new team\,\" he said. \"We have a different team than it was i
 n the past. The last couple of years\, we just outright struggled. This 
 year we haven't. We have played well on the road. There's no reason not 
 to think we are not going to play well the rest of the year.\"\n\n\nThis

DESCRIPTION:Win: 3-1\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- Right-
 hander John Patterson had another solid outing\, and the Nationals defea
 ted the Phillies\, 3-1\, in front of 23\,332 fans at RFK Stadium on Tues
 day night.\n\nPatterson pitched 6 2/3 innings\, and gave up just one run
  on six hits. He struck out six and walked four. In total\, Patterson th
 rew 113 pitches\, 67 of them for strikes.\n\nPatterson got off to a slow
  start\, giving up an RBI single to Jim Thome in the first inning\, but 
 he made adjustments and prevented the Phillies from scoring during his t
 ime on the mound.\n\n\"The Phillies were laying off my offspeed stuff an
 d were just looking for the fastball early in the game. They were just j
 umping on my fastball early in the count\,\" said Patterson. \"I had to 
 slow them down a little bit and start working my fastball in there.\"\n\
 nPatterson is now 2-1\, with a 0.98 ERA. His performance of late hasn't 
 surprised manager Frank Robinson\, who saw a glimpse of Patterson's pote
 ntial before the pitcher tore his groin last April.\n\n\"This is what we
  thought he would do after we got him in a trade with the Diamondbacks\,
 \" said Robinson. \"Now he's putting it together\, and we are reaping th
 e benefits of it. I'm very happy that he's here with us.\n\n\"If you bel
 ieve in your stuff\, then you can get by like he did tonight. That shoul
 d assure him that you don't always have to have your best stuff to win o
 r keep your team in the ballgame.\"\n\nThe Phillies' biggest chance to s
 core came in the seventh inning. They had runners on first and second wi
 th two out\, and Jim Thome coming to the plate. Robinson decided to take
  Patterson out of the game and bring in right-hander Gary Majewski inste
 ad of left-hander Joey Eischen. Robinson decided to give Eischen the day
  off\, as Eischen had pitched four consecutive games.\n\nMajewski came t
 hrough\, inducing Thome to ground out to second to end the inning. Left-
 handed hitters are now 0-for-8 against Majewski.\n\n\"I thought Gary was
  fresh\, and I like his fastball and sinker. He threw the ball in a good
  spot. That's what we needed in that situation\,\" said Robinson.\n\nSai
 d a grateful Patterson: \"I was expecting to see Eischen come flying out
  of the bullpen\, but [Majewski] came in and did a great job to get Thom
 e\, who is their RBI guy. It was perfect.\"\n\nMajewski\, too\, expected
  Eischen to get the call\, and admitted that he was nervous when he reac
 hed the mound.\n\n\"I was happy that Frank wanted me in that situation w
 ith runners on\,\" said Majewski. \"I've been doing good and throwing st
 rikes. He said I could come into these situations and get it done\, and 
 tonight I did.\"\n\nPhillies right-hander Jon Lieber\, Patterson's count
 erpart\, lasted six innings\, giving up three runs on four hits.\n\nThe 
 Nationals' first run was scored in the first\, when Nick Johnson hit a 1
 -0 pitch over the right-center-field wall for his first home run of the 
 season. The hit extended his hitting streak to 16 games.\n\n\"It was a f
 astball -- middle in. I was trying to get on base and hit the ball hard.
  The ball went out of the park\, and I took off running\,\" said Johnson
 .\n\nJohnson would later leave the game with a contusion on the back of 
 his right leg\, and is listed as day-to-day. He hurt the leg when he fou
 led off a pitch in the third inning. He is not expected to play on Wedne
 sday afternoon against the Phillies.\n\nThe Nationals took the lead in t
 he fifth inning. With one out\, Patterson doubled near the right-field l
 ine. The next hitter\, Brad Wilkerson\, hit a two-run home run into the 
 right-field upper deck -- a shot that hit above the 470-foot sign -- to 
 give the Nationals the two-run lead.\n\nIt was the first multi-homer gam
 e at RFK this season.\n\n\"Lieber's strength is the cutter. He was tryin
 g to keep me off the outside part of the plate\,\" said Wilkerson. \"He 
 started me inside\, and I got a fastball in and hit the home run. It fel
 t really good to jump ahead\, because Patterson threw a great game for u
 s.\n\n\"I was hoping that the ball would stay fair. I knew it had the di
 stance\, but I really didn't see where it ended up. I was trying to run 
 the bases and enjoy the trot.\"\n\nMajewski\, Luis Ayala and Chad Corder
 o shut out the Phillies the rest of the way\, with Cordero picking up hi
 s fourth save of the season.\n\nThe Nationals improved their record to 1
 1-10\, and the Phillies have fallen to 9-12.\n\n\n\nBill Ladson is a rep

 m\n\nPHILADELPHIA -- Outfielder Kenny Lofton spoiled Washington's debut 
 by driving in three runs and scoring two more as the Phillies defeated t
 he Nationals\, 8-4\, in front of 44\,080 fans at Citizens Bank Park on M
 onday afternoon.\n\nNationals starter Livan Hernandez (0-1)\, who was ph
 enomenal during Spring Training\, wasn't able to get through the fifth i
 nning. He gave up seven runs in 4 2/3 innings.\n\nHernandez was given a 
 1-0 lead in the second when Terrmel Sledge drove in the first run in Nat
 ionals history\, grounding out to second to score Nick Johnson.\n\nWith 
 the bases loaded in the bottom of the second\, the Phillies' Mike Lieber
 thal grounded out to Johnson at first base\, but Pat Burrell scored on t
 he play to tie the score at 1. Phillies starter Jon Lieber (1-0) followe
 d with a sacrifice fly to drive in Lofton.\n\nThe Phillies added two mor
 e runs before Lofton hit Hernandez's first pitch for a three-run homer i
 n the fifth to give Philadelphia a commanding 7-1 lead. Lofton went 2-fo
 r-3 in the game.\n\nThe Nationals made it a game by the seventh. With tw
 o outs in the sixth\, Sledge connected on Lieber's first pitch for the f
 ranchise's first home run\, a two-run shot to make it 7-3. Lieber pitche
 d 5 2/3 innings and gave up three runs on 10 hits.\n\nThe Nationals had 
 a golden opportunity to take the lead in the seventh. After the National
 s scored a run in the inning on a bases-loaded walk to Vinny Castilla\, 
 Sledge came to the plate as the go-ahead run\, but Ryan Madson induced t
 he left-handed hitter to hit into a double play to end the threat.\n\nTh
 e Phillies scored the last run of the game in the seventh off Antonio Os
 una\, who gave up a bases-loaded sacrifice fly to Chase Utley to make it
  an 8-4 game.\n\nThis story was not subject to the approval of Major Lea

DESCRIPTION:Loss: 6-7\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nHOUSTON -- Right-ha
 nder Livan Hernandez had a great night with the bat\, but his pitching w
 asn't as sharp as the Astros edged the Nationals\, 7-6\, in front of 34\
 ,309 at Minute Maid Park on Wednesday.\nThe Nationals saw their record d
 rop to 59-54\, and find themselves two games behind Houston in the Wild 
 Card race and 6 1/2 games behind the Braves in the National League East.
 \n\nHernandez went 3-for-3 in the game\, including his second home run o
 f the season\, but he gave up seven runs -- five earned -- in six inning
 s. Hernandez has now given up nine earned runs in his last 11 2/3 inning
 s\, causing his ERA to rise from 3.27 to 3.51.\n\nAfter Tuesday's game\,
  Robinson expressed his concern about Hernandez.\n\n\"I'm trying to figu
 re out what it is. It can't be much\, but it is especially early in the 
 ballgame [to get hit hard]. It's not like him\,\" Robinson said.\n\nHern
 andez said that his right knee\, which has been bothering him since mid-
 May\, was not giving him any problems on the mound. He said that he has 
 to find a way to get out of the first inning\, which hasn't been the cas
 e in his last two starts.\n\nBut the turning point of the game occurred 
 in the bottom of the fourth inning with the score tied at 4. With two ou
 ts\, Willy Tavares singled\, and then scored all the way from first base
  on a double by Craig Biggio.\n\nThe Astros added to their lead in the b
 ottom of the sixth inning. After Humberto Quintero singled\, pinch-hitte
 r Chris Burke sacrificed Quintero to second base\, but Hernandez mishand
 led the ball and Burke was safe at first base.\n\n\"I couldn't get the b
 all out of my hand. I wanted to go to second base. I knew Quintero wasn'
 t running well\,\" Hernandez said.\n\nTwo outs later\, Hernandez intenti
 onally walked Lance Berkman to load the bases and face Morgan Ensberg. T
 he plan backfired\, as Ensberg doubled to right-center field to score bo
 th Quintero and Burke.\n\n\"Berkman is a difficult hitter. Everybody kno
 ws that. And I was having a good day with Ensberg\,\" Hernandez said.\n\
 nThe Nationals made it a ballgame in the ninth with closer Brad Lidge on
  the mound. With two outs\, Nick Johnson drove in Carlos Baerga with a d
 ouble down the right-field line.\n\nAfter Vinny Castilla walked to put r
 unners on first and second\, Brad Wilkerson singled to right-center to d
 rive in Johnson and make it a one-run game.\n\nRobinson then made a deci
 sion that he called \"a no-brainer.\" He had Jose Guillen pinch-hit for 
 Preston Wilson\, who has looked overmatched at the plate. It was Guillen
 's first appearance since Aug. 5. He had missed the last three games bec
 ause of a slight tear in his rotator cuff.\n\nGuillen battled with Lidge
 \, but he ended up striking out to end the game.\n\n\"The press would ha
 ve been after me if I didn't [pinch-hit for Wilson]\,\" Robinson said.\n
 \nThe Nationals got off to a good start when Jose Vidro homered off left
 -hander Wandy Rodriguez in the bottom of the first inning to give Washin
 gton a 1-0 lead.\n\nThe Astros struck back with four runs of their own o
 ff Hernandez. Orlando Palmeiro highlighted the scoring with a three-run 
 double.\n\n\"I felt good. I had a very bad first inning\, and that was t
 he ballgame. The last two games\, teams have scored in the first inning.
  Sometimes that happens to a starting pitcher\,\" Hernandez said.\n\nBut
  the Nationals would tie the score off Rodriguez by the top of the fourt
 h inning. In the third\, Hernandez drove in Wilson with a double down th
 e third-base line\, and Brandon Watson later scored Jamey Carroll with a
  groundout to second base.\n\nIn the bottom of the fourth\, Hernandez hi
 t a home run off Rodriguez to tie the score at 4.\n\nThe Nationals had a
  golden opportunity to score more runs in the fifth and sixth innings. I
 n the fifth\, they had runners on first and second with one out\, and Wi
 lkerson hit the ball to deep left-center field. Berkman caught the ball 
 and threw to Biggio\, who realized that Castilla was taking his time get
 ting back to first base. Biggio then threw to first baseman Mike Lamb to
  get Castilla for the double play.\n\nCastilla thought Berkman was going
  to try to get Wilson at second\, or that he would just throw to third.\
 n\n\"I should have run back harder\,\" Castilla admitted.\n\nAccording t
 o a source in the dugout\, Robinson was upset with first-base coach Don 
 Buford for not giving Castilla help on the play. Both Robinson and Bufor
 d did not talk about their conversation\, but Buford felt that he didn't
  need to tell Castilla to hurry up on the play.\n\n\"The ball was hit to
  left field\, and the left fielder was near the wall. Vinny continued on
  and crossed second base\, and I guess he didn't see him catch it. Once 
 he caught it\, Vinny went back to first and he was thrown out\,\" Buford
  said.\n\nWhen asked if he told Castilla to hurry up\, Buford said\, \"H
 urry up? He knows that when the ball is caught you go back to first base
  100 percent. I can't control his running.\"\n\nIn the sixth inning\, Th
 e Nationals had runners on first and second with two outs\, but reliever
  Mike Gallo was able to get Watson to fly out to center field to end the
  inning.\n\nThis story was not subject to the approval of Major League B

DESCRIPTION:Win: 6-1\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- A few 
 minutes after the Nationals wrapped up their 6-1 win over the Phillies a
 t Robert F. Kennedy Stadium on Sunday afternoon\, some of the Nats asked
  manager Frank Robinson if they could play some music in the clubhouse.\
 nThe answer was no. Robinson\, who banned music\, card games\, video gam
 es and cell phones in the clubhouse after Thursday's loss to the Braves\
 , said they could start playing the music on Oct. 3\, which is the day a
 fter the last game of the regular season.\n\n\"We have to pay attention 
 to details right now\, and hopefully we can keep going\,\" Robinson said
 . \"I just think they had to get down to business. They had to pay atten
 tion to the game itself and not all this side stuff and the stuff out on
  the street. They have to focus on playing baseball. That was my view of
  it. And I think they are starting to get that feel.\"\n\nThe Nationals 
 paid attention to details on Sunday and find themselves getting close to
  first place in the National League Wild Card race. With the victory\, t
 he Nationals are now two games behind the Phillies. It's impressive cons
 idering how much the club has struggled during the second half of the se
 ason. Even Robinson is surprised that the Nationals are still in the thi
 ck of the race.\n\n\"It's only because other clubs let us [keep standing
  in the race]\,\" Robinson said. \"They had a chance to knock us out and
  they didn't do. It looks like we are getting our second wind. Hopefully
 \, we can get into the thick of this thing.\"\n\nRight-hander Esteban Lo
 aiza pitched on three days' rest for the second time this season\, throw
 ing eight innings and giving up one run on four hits. He matched his car
 eer high with 11 strikeouts. Loaiza set that personal high against the P
 hillies on April 27.\n\n\"I wanted to go out there and battle\,\" Loaiza
  said. \"We needed this win. I wanted to put some zeroes on the board\, 
 and my teammates responded well with the bats.\"\n\nLoaiza outing was th
 e antithesis of the previous start\, when gave up five runs -- all comin
 g off the bat of Atlanta's Anduw Jones -- in four innings last Wednesday
 .\n\n\"He threw strikes\,\" Robinson said. \"He hit the ball around the 
 strike zone. He used all of his pitches today\, and he was ahead of the 
 hitters. He made them swing the bat and made pitches to get them out.\"\
 n\nThe Nationals used the long ball to help Loaiza win his 10th game of 
 the season. With Gavin Floyd on the mound in the second inning\, Brian S
 chneider gave Washington a 3-0 lead by hitting the first pitch over the 
 right-field wall for a three-run homer.\n\n\"I just tried to be aggressi
 ve\,\" Schneider said. \"I got a good pitch to hit and put the best swin
 g I could on it. We haven't given [Loaiza] that many runs this year. To 
 give [Loaiza] a three-run lead to work with is new. [We wanted to] let h
 im get comfortable\, be aggressive\, and go right after guys and not wor
 ry about giving up runs.\"\n\nIn the seventh inning\, with Phils relieve
 r Pedro Liriano on the hill\, Preston Wilson launched a three-run shot o
 f his own into the upper deck in left-center field. Overall\, he went 3-
 for-4 and scored two runs.\n\nAfter the game\, Wilson said it's too earl
 y to tell if Robinson's rules have made a difference on the team\, but W
 ilson believes that more focus has to be placed on the field.\n\n\"Hopef
 ully\, everybody's focus is more on the game\, or the pitcher that we ar
 e facing\, or the hitters that we are facing\,\" Wilson said. \"We can c
 hannel that and get a little bit better outcome in certain situations. T
 he problem is that teams haven't been beating us. It has been execution\
 , whether it would be bunt plays\, making wrong pitches\, [or] swinging 
 at bad pitches.\n\n\"I think the more we study and pay attention to what
  guys are doing\, we might be able to pick up tendencies and might be ab
 le to do the little things a little bit better.\"\n\nThe Phillies scored
  their only run in the eighth\, when Jason Michaels singled to right fie
 ld to score Jimmy Rollins.\n\nJoey Eischen and Jason Bergmann shut the P

 m on Friday night.\n\nWillis pitched his fifth career complete game and 
 gave up just five hits. He struck out three and walked just one. The Nat

 is also helped himself with the bat by going 2-for-4 with two RBIs.\n\nN
 ationals right-hander Tomo Ohka\, who had one of the five hits\, gave up
  three runs in six solid innings. However\, Ohka's record dropped to 1-9
  against the Marlins.\n\nOhka needed to find a way to stop Juan Pierre\,
  Luis Castillo and Miguel Cabrera\, all of whom have a .385 career batti

 astillo walked\, he stole second and went to third on a throwing error b

 .\n\nAlex Gonzalez then singled to center to drive in Castillo.\n\nIn th

SUMMARY:(L) vs Reds
DESCRIPTION:Loss: 3-5\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- Brad 
 Wilkerson may have said it best: \"It's gut-check time for the Nationals
 .\"\nAfter losing a 5-3 game to the Reds on Thursday afternoon\, Washing
 ton finds itself sinking fast in the playoff race.\n\nThe Nationals\, wh
 o are now all alone in fifth place\, are six games behind the Braves in 
 the National League East and 2 1/2 games behind the Phillies in the NL W
 ild Card race.\n\nWashington will next face St. Louis for a three-game w
 eekend set. Wilkerson said the series could determine whether or not the
  Nationals remain in contention for a playoff spot.\n\n\"It's going to b
 e one of those series where we can cash it in or bounce back\, show some
  heart and play some good baseball\,\" Wilkerson said \"We have to come 
 out with a sense of urgency right from the get-go.\n\n\"These next three
  games are going to tell a lot about this team\, to see if we have enoug
 h heart to bounce back from a tough series loss at home. The Cardinals a
 re a tough team. Everybody knows that they are one of the best teams in 
 the National League. If we come out and play good\, hard baseball\, we'l
 l have a chance to beat them. If not\, they are going to kick our butts.
 \"\n\nThe Reds are not one of the best teams in the National League. In 
 fact\, they are nine games under .500. But the Reds have had their way w
 ith the Nationals this season and Thursday was no different.\n\nAs seems
  to be the pattern\, the Nationals' offense was the problem. Washington 
 couldn't get any offense going until the ninth inning\, when Wilkerson h
 it a two-run home run. By that time\, it was too late.\n\nBrandon Clauss
 en (9-8) started for the Reds. The lefty lasted 5 2/3 innings and gave u
 p one unearned run on six hits.\n\nThe Nationals had numerous opportunit
 ies to score off the left-hander\, but didn't take advantage.\n\nIn the 
 fourth inning\, the Nationals had runners on first and second and one ou
 t\, but starter Livan Hernandez hit into a double play.\n\nIn the sixth\
 , the Nats put runners on first and second with one out\, but Gary Benne
 tt popped up for the second out of the inning.\n\n\"I was trying to get 
 a ball that I could hit hard\,\" Bennett said. \"The first pitch I swung
  through was the one to do it. [Then\, Claussen] threw me a curve and I 
 popped up.\"\n\nReliever Matt Belisle then entered the game and induced 
 a ground ball from Carlos Baerga to end the inning.\n\nAs far as the Nat
 s' offense is concerned\, manager Frank Robinson said the players are go
 ing to have to find a way to get it going themselves the way they did in
  the first half of the season\, when they were tops in the NL East. The 
 Nationals rank last in the Major Leagues in nearly every major offensive
  category.\n\n\"I'm not ducking anything or saying that's it's not my re
 sponsibility\,\" Robinson said. \"I didn't do anything to light a fire u
 nder them the first half. They did it by winning games\, getting the big
  clutch hits\, making the big plays and pitching well. That's what fired
  these guys up. Not me.\"\n\nHernandez started for the Nationals and con
 tinued to experience problems. He lasted six innings\, giving up four ru
 ns on 10 hits. He struck out five batters and walked three.\n\nAfter the
  start\, he acknowledged that his right knee had been hurting him on the
  mound and that he needed to get fluid drained out of the knee on Friday
 . Hernandez has been hobbled by the knee since May 15.\n\n\"The reason I
  can't complete my pitches is because my knee is not 100 percent\,\" Her
 nandez said. \"The mechanics [are different]. I'm trying to throw strike
 s\, but it doesn't happen\,\"\n\nOffensively\, it was all Reds from the 
 fifth inning on. With the score tied at 1\, Austin Kearns drove in Ken G
 riffey Jr. with a single to center field to give the Nationals a 2-1 lea
 d.\n\nHernandez didn't get an out in the seventh inning. The Reds scored
  three runs in the frame\, highlighted by a Griffey home run.\n\n\"I nee
 d to throw a few more strikes\,\" Hernandez said. \"I walked three peopl
 e in the first inning. I've walked too many people this year.\"\n\nThe R
 eds won five out of six games against the Nationals this season.\n\nThis

SUMMARY:(L) vs Astros
DESCRIPTION:Loss: 1-4\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- Sunda
 y's box score said that Eric Bruntlett's three-run home run off reliever
  Hector Carrasco in the top of the 14th inning was the reason the Nation
 als were defeated by the Astros\, 4-1\, at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium.\nB
 ut the truth is\, Washington's offense was the reason it lost the game. 
 During his postgame press conference\, manager Frank Robinson said somet
 hing was missing on the ballclub.\n\nIt's simple: The Nationals don't ha
 ve a gameplan at the plate. The hitters often find themselves in hitter'
 s counts and\, too much of the time\, can't take advantage of the situat
 ion.\n\nThe eighth inning was the biggest example of how rough it was at
  the plate on Sunday. The Nationals had runners on first and third\, no 
 outs and the game tied at 1. All they needed was a fly ball to take the 
 lead. With the infield in\, Brian Schneider took Chad Qualls' 2-1 pitch 
 and hit a ground ball right at second baseman Jose Vizcaino for the firs
 t out of the inning.\n\n\"I was looking to elevate the ball. I never fac
 ed Qualls before\,\" Schneider said. \"He had a good sinker. They first 
 two pitches were pretty good and then he threw me a 2-0 slider and then 
 he went back to sinker. I didn't do a good job of getting a pitch up in 
 the zone.\"\n\nRyan Church was the next hitter. On a 1-0 pitch\, Church 
 half-swung and hit the ball right at Qualls for the second out.\n\n\"I j
 ust had a brainfart and left my barrel out there instead of getting it o
 ut of the way or just swinging through it. I knew what they were doing. 
 I wasn't really focused and didn't get my bat out of the way\,\" Church 
 said.\n\nBrad Wilkerson followed and had an 2-0 advantage against Qualls
 \, but eventually struck out.\n\nFor the game\, the Nationals collected 
 just four hits and struck out 13 times. During the second half of the se
 ason\, the team is hitting .172 with five home runs and 30 RBIs.\n\n\"Of
 fensively\, we are trying to hit the ball too far\, trying to hit the lo
 ng ball. You have to deal with the situation as it is\,\" said hitting c
 oach Tom McCraw\, who has seen the team batting average dip to .255. \"I
 f it calls for a single\, you try for a single. It's not pressing. It's 
 just not hitting what the game calls for.\n\n\"It has been frustrating t
 he last 10 to 12 days. Today was no more than before. What is disgusting
  is that we are letting very good pitching go to waste.\"\n\nNationals s
 tarter John Patterson has been outstanding this season\, but Sunday was 
 arguably his best outing. He pitched eight innings\, gave up one run on 
 six hits and struck out a career-high 10 batters. Patterson has an outsi
 de chance of striking out 200 batters this season.\n\n\"It's maybe the b
 est game I have thrown this year as far as my stuff went -- location and
  competitiveness\,\" Patterson said. \"I'm not going for the strikeouts.
  I'm not trying to do it. I'm locating my pitches. I'm learning how to s
 trikeout batters.\"\n\nPatterson said he was excited that he could win h
 is second straight decision after seeing that the Nationals had runners 
 on first and third and no outs in the eighth inning. Patterson said it k
 nocked the wind out of the club when they didn't score.\n\n\"I don't kno
 w if we are trying to hard. We are just not getting the job done. We hav
 e to find something\,\" said Paterson\, who now has 12 no-decisions.\n\n
 Patterson and Astros left-hander Wandy Rodriguez found themselves in a p
 itchers' duel\, but neither figured in the decision.\n\nRodriguez pitche
 d seven-plus innings and gave up one run on three hits.\n\nThe Nationals
  took a 1-0 lead off Rodriguez in the fifth inning when Gary Bennett sin
 gled to right field to drive in Marlon Byrd.\n\nBut the Astros tied the 
 score at 1 in the top of the sixth. Lance Berkman led off and hit a fly 
 ball to deep left field. Both Patterson and left fielder Marlon Byrd tho
 ught the ball was gone for a home run. But the ball started to come down
  as it reached the warning track and Byrd misjudged the ball as it hit t
 he left-field wall.\n\n\"I put my head down and I took my eight to 10 st
 eps\,\" Byrd said. When I looked back up\, I knew where the ball and the
  wall [were]. The ball was where I thought it would be. If I took a bett
 er route\, knowing that the ball was going to slice to left\, the ball w
 ould have come right to me.\"\n\nThe Nationals now go Atlanta to play a 
 three-game series against the Braves\, who are in a first-place tie with
  Washington. Robinson said the Nationals are not going to have a chance 
 in the three-game series unless their hitting comes around.\n\n\"Everybo
 dy has to get a wake-up call here. Everybody has to start doing their pa
 rt. That's what it's going to take\, and we are not doing that\,\" Robin
 son said. \"Something is missing on this ballclub. Whatever it is\, I ha
 ve to figure out what it is. This is the not the same ballclub that play
 ed most of the first half. I don't mean personnel. I'm talking about the
  way we are going about our jobs.\"\n\nThis story was not subject to the

DESCRIPTION:Loss: 4-5\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- A wei
 rd thing happened at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium on Tuesday night. The Dod
 gers played Home Run Derby and edged the Nationals\, 5-4\, in front of 3
 6\,277.\nThe Nationals have lost 11 consecutive one-run games and find t
 hemselves 5 1/2 games behind the Braves in the National League East stan
 dings.\n\nRFK Stadium is known as a pitcher's park\, but the Dodgers did
 n't seem to have any problems as they hit four home runs in the game. It
 's the first time an opponent has hit more than two homers against the N
 ationals at RFK.\n\nThe last time an opponent hit at least two homers at
  the Nationals' home park was July 22\, when Morgan Ensberg and Mike Lam
 b of the Astros both went deep.\n\nThe turning point of the game occurre
 d in the top of the seventh inning. With the score tied at 2\, Dodgers f
 irst baseman Jason Phillips took Esteban Loaiza's 3-1 pitch over the lef
 t-field wall for a two-run homer to give the Dodgers a 4-2 lead.\n\n\"I 
 talked to some guys on the Mets and they said the place was real big\, b
 ut in batting practice\, the ball was carrying down the line to the bull
 pens\,\" said Phillips\, a former Met.\n\nLoaiza pitched seven innings a
 nd gave up four runs on five hits\, three of which were long balls to Je
 ff Kent\, Jason Repko and Phillips. Loaiza struck out four batters and w
 alked just one.\n\n\"I threw my pitches for strikes. I thought Kent was 
 taking the first pitch in his first at-bat. I threw a fastball trying to
  get ahead of the count and he went deep\,\" Loaiza said. \"The other tw
 o were cutters in\, but they were on the middle of the plate and I wante
 d to get a ground ball\, especially on [the one to Phillips].\n\n\"I was
  surprised by all the home runs that were hit today. The ball hasn't bee
 n flying when we play here. Today\, the Dodgers were a home run-hitting 
 team.\"\n\nReliever Hector Carrasco was just as surprised about the long
  ball as Loaiza. Carrasco thought he threw a perfect inside pitch to Hee
 -Seop Choi in the top of the eighth inning\, but Choi's ball cleared the
  right-field wall for his 14th home run of the season\, giving the Dodge
 rs a 5-2 lead.\n\n\"The stadium is pretty big. When he hit that ball\, I
  didn't think it would get out\,\" Carrasco said.\n\nThe Nationals were 
 not as fortunate when it came to hitting homers. In the second inning\, 
 Brad Wilkerson hit a ball over the head of Milton Bradley in center fiel
 d. The ball landed near the warning track\, and Wilkerson had to settle 
 for a two-run triple. Wilkerson was left stranded as Jose Vidro flied ou
 t to left field and Jose Guillen popped up to shortstop Cesar Izturis.\n
 \n\"I felt like I hit it pretty good\, but I hit it [to] the wrong part 
 of the park\,\" Wilkerson said. \"We need to take advantage of the oppor
 tunities after the big hit. With less than two outs\, we need to get tha
 t run in and we didn't do it. It seems to always come back and get us in
  the end.\"\n\nIn the eighth inning\, Nick Johnson raked one to center f
 ield that looked like it had a chance to leave the park\, but it was cau
 ght at the warning track by Bradley.\n\nThe Nationals\, however\, made i
 t a one-run game in the eighth off two relievers. With Steve Schmoll on 
 the mound with one out\, Vinny Castilla hit a sacrifice fly to center fi
 eld to score Vidro.\n\nWith runners on first and third and Jonathan Brox
 ton on the mound with two outs\, Preston Wilson stole second base and ca
 tcher Dioner Navarro's throw to second base went to center field\, which
  allowed Guillen to score.\n\nIt looked like the Nationals might at leas
 t tie the score in the ninth. With two outs\, Vidro collected a base hit
  off closer Yhency Brazoban. Vidro took a chance and stretched it to a d
 ouble. At first\, it appeared that Vidro would be out by several feet\, 
 but he made it to the base by avoiding Kent's tag.\n\n\"I'm not doing th
 e team any good by being at first base with two outs. Obviously\, I thou
 ght I had a chance to make it to second. It took a great slide by me to 
 be safe out there\,\" Vidro said.\n\nBut Guillen made the final out of t
 he game when he grounded out to Brazoban.\n\nThis story was not subject

SUMMARY:(L) @ St. Louis
DESCRIPTION:Loss: 1-3\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nST. LOUIS -- Right-
 hander Esteban Loaiza had one bad inning on Saturday night\, and it prov
 ed costly as the Nationals lost to the Cardinals\, 3-1\, in front of 49\
 ,123 at Busch Stadium.\nThe Nationals have now lost five consecutive gam
 es and seven of their last eight.\n\nLoaiza pitched six solid innings an
 d gave up just three runs on eight hits. He struck out six and walked on
 e.\n\nBut it was the second inning that was Loaiza's downfall. Jim Edmon
 ds gave the Cardinals a 1-0 lead by hitting his ninth home run over the 
 center-field fence. Edmonds now has two home runs and five RBIs in his l
 ast two games.\n\n\"I wanted to go low and away\, but the ball stayed ri
 ght at the middle of the plate\,\" Loaiza said.\n\nTwo outs later\, with
  Mark Grudzielanek on first base\, Yadier Molina sent an 0-2 pitch over 
 the left-field wall to give the Cards a 3-0 lead.\n\n\"I tried to work [
 Molina] hard and in and I tried to get him off the plate\, then I threw 
 a four-seamer up and in. He put the bat on the ball for a home run\,\" L
 oaiza said. \"Other than that\, I went out there and battled and tried t
 o win.\"\n\nThe Nationals couldn't muster any offense against Cardinals 
 right-hander Jeff Suppan. He had a no-hitter until the sixth inning\, wh
 en Brad Wilkerson broke it up with a one-out single.\n\nIn that inning\,
  the Nationals had a golden opportunity to score even more runs. With on
 e out and the bases loaded\, Nick Johnson walked to force Wilkerson home
 \, but Vinny Castilla then hit into a double play to end the inning.\n\n
 \"I was trying to hit the ball hard somewhere\, and I hit the ball on th
 e ground\,\" Castilla said. \"He threw a running fastball away. I tried 
 to do too much with it.\"\n\nSuppan went on to pitch seven solid innings
 \, giving up just the one run on four hits. Manager Frank Robinson finds
  it hard to believe that the pitchers the Nationals have been facing lat
 ely are all so good.\n\n\"The offense is not competing. Whoever [opposin
 g managers] throw out there\, they look like Cy Young\,\" Robinson said.
  \"After a while\, you have to put the blame where the blame is. ... We 
 have the same type of at-bats. I can't believe that all the pitchers goi
 ng out there are that good.\"\n\nInfielder Carlos Baerga\, one of the Na
 tionals' team leaders\, believes that D.C. hitters are not making adjust
 ments at the plate. After the Nationals were swept by the Reds\, Baerga 
 feels that the word is\, throw Nationals nothing but breaking balls to g
 et them out.\n\n\"We're swinging at bad pitches with men on base\,\" Bae
 rga said. \"[The Cardinals] have scouts. They know how we hit in Cincinn
 ati. So they are basically pitching almost the same to us here. So we ha
 ve to make adjustments.\"\n\nLike right-hander Matt Morris the previous 
 night\, Suppan threw his share of offspeed pitches against the Nationals
 .\n\n\"You feed off what's going on with another pitcher\,\" Suppan said
 . \"We talk a lot. I noticed some things. We have some likenesses\, but 
 there are some differences. But I had to use what was working for me. My
  first goal was to stay down in the zone. I tried to locate my offspeed 
 pitches\, my changeup and my cutter. I mixed in some curveballs. Basical
 ly\, I just took that approach.\"\n\nThe Nationals continue to have diff
 iculty scoring runs for Loaiza. Entering Saturday's action\, Loaiza has 
 the lowest run support (1.90) per nine innings in the Major Leagues.\n\n
 The last time\, the Nationals scored more than three runs for Loaiza was
  on May 3 against the Dodgers. Loaiza picked up his only win of the seas
 on that day.\n\n\"I haven't had that much run support\, but I know that 
 my teammates are battling and playing 110 percent\,\" Loaiza said. \"The
 y are trying to get on base. Good pitching beats good hitting\, and that
 's what St Louis is doing right now -- and that's what the Reds did.\"\n
 \nThe Nationals are now 24-25 and find themselves under .500 for the fir
 st time since April 11\, when they were 3-4.\n\n\"We are in a funk right
  now. It's time for the real ballplayers to step up and be men. We have 
 to start doing our job the way we are supposed to\,\" outfielder Jose Gu
 illen said. \"Loaiza pitched great\, except for the first inning. Hittin
 g\, we are bad. The only guy that is having good at-bats is Nick Johnson
 . Still\, you win as a team\, and you lose as a team. We have to keep ba
 ttling and get out of the slump. Who knows what could happen?\"\n\nThis

 - Left-hander Dontrelle Willis pitched six solid innings and helped the 
 Marlins defeat the Nationals\, 9-4\, in front of 24\,003 at Robert F. Ke
 nnedy Stadium on Monday night.\n\nThe loss snapped the Nationals' five-g
 ame winning streak. It also was Washington's first loss at home.\n\nWill
 is (3-0) handcuffed the Nationals for the second time in 10 days. On Apr
 il 8\, Willis shut out Washington in a complete-game victory. On Monday\
 , he gave up three runs on six hits.\n\n\"The one thing you have to give
  him credit for is that he has good stuff\,\" manager Frank Robinson sai
 d of Willis. \"Why he dominates us\, I don't know.\"\n\nBrad Wilkerson f
 illed in the blanks for Robinson.\n\n\"When he has that movement in his 
 pitches\, he's down in the zone. He's tough\,\" Wilkerson said. \"He is 
 staying away from the big inning.\"\n\nOne thing the Nationals did do ag
 ainst Willis was break his 24-inning scoreless streak to start the seaso
 n. Jose Vidro launched the first pitch he saw in the seventh for his thi
 rd homer of 2005. The Nationals wound up scoring two more runs in the in
 ning off Willis.\n\n\"They're definitely going to make some kind of adju
 stment from my last start\, being so recent\,\" Willis said. \"But you s
 till have got to throw strikes and just hope that your game plan is good
 .\"\n\nNationals right-hander Tomo Ohka (1-2) had serious problems findi

 d five batters and paid dearly for it in the fifth inning.\n\nPaul Lo Du
 ca led off the fifth with a walk. One out later\, he advanced to second 
 on an error by catcher Gary Bennett. Juan Pierre then singled to right-c

  passed ball by Bennett.\n\n\"Unfortunately\, I put him [Ohka] in a posi
 tion he should not have been in\,\" Bennett said. \"I had a bunt\, I did
 n't make the play there. I had a ball go off my glove. It put him in a s
 pot he should have never been in.\"\n\nOhka didn't record an out before 
 he left the game in the sixth inning. Juan Encarnacion doubled to drive 
 in Miguel Cabrera. After Ohka left the game\, reliever T.J. Tucker enter
 ed and gave up a sacrifice fly to Lo Duca.\n\nOhka allowed four runs -- 
 three earned -- in five innings. He has now walked 11 batters in his las
 t 11 innings.\n\n\"He wasn't sharp. He was behind the hitters\,\" Robins
 on said. \"I don't think we played well. I think we hurt ourselves in th
 e fifth inning. You have a leadoff walk\; you have an error on a play wh
 ere they are giving you an out\; you can't pick up the bunt play\; you g

  is one of his best pitches -- he doesn't seem to be able to control it 
 in the strike zone. He usually locates his fastball much better. He is n
 ot getting strikeouts. More than anything\, he seems like he's not there
 . He is not as intense as you would like to see him. He has been in the 
 past when he was on top of his game.\"\n\nReliever Joe Horgan gave up th
 e remaining five runs in the seventh inning. Overall this season\, he ha
 s allowed nine runs in four innings.\n\n\"I went out there today and tri

DESCRIPTION:Win: 9-2\n\nBy Owen Perkins / Special to MLB.com\n\nDENVER -
 - It's no surprise that the Washington hitters have enjoyed their journe
 y to the Mile High City. The lineup looked like an All-Star squad\, bash
 ing 21 runs on 30 hits in three days.\nBut who'd have thought that the p
 itchers would fall for Coors Field as they have? Over the three-game set
 \, the Nationals starters pitched a total of 20 1/3 innings\, yielding j
 ust two runs for a 0.89 ERA.\n\n\"That's pretty good\,\" admitted manage
 r Frank Robinson. \"We've been pitching well all year long. They've been
  the real backbone of this ballclub this year.\"\n\nOn Sunday\, John Pat
 terson showed the backbone to complete the sweep\, with a 9-2 defeat of 
 the Rockies. The Nats had put together a string of 17 2/3 consecutive sc
 oreless innings before the eighth\, when a Todd Helton double\, an iffy 
 hit from Matt Holliday that scooted under third baseman Carlos Baerga's 
 glove\, and a shallow foul fly to right from Luis Gonzalez kept the Rock
 ies from being shut out twice in a row at home for the first time in nea
 rly 11 seasons at Coors Field.\n\nPatterson's performance topped the pre
 vious night's six shutout innings from Tony Armas. Patterson allowed nin
 e hits in eight innings\, but unlike Armas and three relievers on Saturd
 ay night\, who all pitched through heavy traffic\, he was able to put to
 gether a lone one-two-three inning.\n\n\"I didn't have pinpoint control 
 today\,\" said Patterson. \"There were times when I needed to go out and
  get a fastball down and away\, and I'd miss. I haven't been doing that 
 much this year. I've been making those pitches.\"\n\nEight innings of on
 e-run ball in Colorado's thin air aside\, Patterson was not simply being
  modest. By all accounts\, he wasn't at his sharpest. But even when he's
  had his \"A\" game going\, he's been snake-bitten by poor run support\,
  so the tradeoff worked to his benefit on Sunday.\n\n\"He didn't have hi
 s best stuff today\, but that just goes to show the kind of stuff he doe
 s have\,\" said his catcher\, Gary Bennett. \"He had his fastball. When 
 he had to make pitches\, he did.\"\n\nPatterson and Gary Majewski\, who 
 pitched the ninth\, stranded 10 Rockies runners. The four runs that the 
 Rockies did score over the three days were the fewest they have scored i
 n a three-game series since Coors Field opened\, in 1995.\n\nThe park te
 nds to make pitchers uncomfortable\, but Patterson's self-described disc
 omfort was more of his own making.\n\n\"Mechanically\, my body and stuff
 \, I wasn't really in synch\,\" he said. \"My delivery wasn't as smooth 
 and fluid as it has been. It was just a little stiff. I never got comfor
 table.\"\n\nThrough the game's first three frames\, none of the National
 s could get comfortable\, and it was looking as though the Washington lu
 mber was up to its old slumber-party tricks\, giving Patterson an added 
 edge of anxiety. While the Rockies took any advantage they could\, putti
 ng runners on base in eight of nine innings\, the Nationals couldn't fin
 d first base through the first three\, as Colorado starter Jose Acevedo 
 retired the first nine batters in order.\n\n\"You have to give him credi
 t\, but it looked like we were flat\, too\,\" said Robinson of Acevedo's
  performance. \"He was pitching very well the first few innings\, making
  some good pitches.\"\n\nBrad Wilkerson\, back in the lineup after a two
 -day hiatus\, finally got the ball rolling in the top of the fourth with
  a leadoff single to right. That was followed by a single from Jose Vidr
 o\, who went 3-for-4 on the day\, and a sacrifice fly from Nick Johnson\
 , the first of four RBIs for the first baseman. A run-scoring single fro
 m Preston Wilson made it 2-0\, but it was the fifth inning that was the 
 decisive statement from the Nationals.\n\nIn that frame\, Washington put
  up five runs\, four of which came courtesy of back-to-back homers from 
 Johnson and Jose Guillen\, the first homers the Nationals hit in their t
 hree-day stay in Colorado.\n\nThe long-ball draught may never have ended
  had it not been for a questionable move on the part of the Rockies to i
 ntentionally walk Wilkerson and face Vidro with two out and two on. Vidr
 o was hitting .625 (5-for-8) in the series heading into the at-bat\, whe
 reas Wilkerson had been benched with a sore shoulder for two days.\n\n\"
 You take a lot of pride in playing this game\,\" said Vidro of the situa
 tion\, describing his sense of being challenged by the moment. \"I felt 
 it was strange. Wilky was out two games in a row here\, and I was swingi
 ng the bat good the last couple of games. I really want to get a hit in 
 those situations. You bring your energy up\, and you want to come throug
 h. I think that changed the whole game right there.\"\n\nVidro came thro
 ugh with an RBI single\, and Johnson and Guillen followed with the dinge
 r duet\, putting Washington ahead\, 7-0\, and taking the pressure off Pa
 tterson.\n\nThe inning ended with another taste of drama\, as Acevedo pl
 unked Wilson immediately following the Guillen homer. He may have been o
 ffering retribution for Patterson hitting Helton in the first\, but what
 ever the reason\, the intent seemed clear to Robinson\, who bristled at 
 the even-handed warning from home-plate umpire Jerry Layne.\n\n\"I was u
 pset to the extent that it was so obvious that it was intentional\,\" sa
 id Robinson. \"The rules say that if in the eyes of the umpire\, he feel
 s like it was intentional\, he doesn't have to give out a warning or any
 thing\, he can just throw the guy out. I haven't seen a much more obviou
 s situation than that one today.\"\n\nWilson took his base and made the 
 final out of the inning trying to steal second. Trying to take a base li
 ke that with a seven-run lead tends to ruffle the feathers of the traili
 ng team\, but the Rockies are accustomed to the philosophy that no lead 
 is safe at Coors Field. Robinson\, on the other hand\, took one exceptio
 n with Wilson's antic\, which he saw as a retaliatory move for being hit
  by the pitch.\n\n\"The only thing I didn't like about him stealing was 
 he went in headfirst\,\" said Robinson. \"Acevedo is not going to pay th
 e price for what he did\, and we won't see him until maybe next year. Wh
 at he should have done was made the infielder pay the price.\"\n\nThe Na
 ts never trailed while in Colorado\, and with Houston losing earlier in 
 the day\, they are a mere one game back in the National League Wild Card
  race.\n\n\nThis story was not subject to the approval of Major League B

SUMMARY:(L) vs Mets
DESCRIPTION:Loss: 2-5\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- Manag
 er Frank Robinson is known to put in his best relievers in close ballgam
 es\, but that wasn't the case on Monday afternoon as the Nationals lost 
 to the Mets\, 5-2\, in front of 44\,331 fans at Robert F. Kennedy Stadiu
 m.\nThe loss snapped the Nationals' six-game winning streak and dropped 
 their record to 50-32.\n\nWith the score tied at 2 in the ninth inning\,
  Robinson opted to have long man Sunny Kim pitch his second inning of re
 lief. Normally\, Chad Cordero\, Gary Majewski\, Joey Eischen or Hector C
 arrasco would have received the call\, but each of them was not availabl
 e. The bullpen has been used a lot in recent weeks\, and Robinson wanted
  to give his late-inning relievers some rest.\n\n\"Sooner or later\, the
 y have to sit down and relax\,\" Robinson said.\n\nPrior to Monday's act
 ion\, Cordero\, the best closer in baseball this season\, pitched in fiv
 e out of six games\; Carrasco had pitched in four straight\; and Eischen
  pitched in two straight since coming off the disabled list. Majewski\, 
 on the other hand\, is being monitored by Robinson and pitching coach Ra
 ndy St. Claire because prior to this season he had never pitched three d
 ays in a row. Furthermore\, Majewski was throwing in the bullpen during 
 games five days in a row.\n\n\"I told them I was good to go\, but it's j
 ust one of those things\,\" Majewski said. \"You have to protect guys\, 
 instead of getting more guys injured.\"\n\nWhile the Nationals' late-inn
 ing pitchers were being protected\, the Mets went to work on Kim.\n\nWit
 h a runner on second base\, pinch-hitter Jose Offerman took a 3-2 pitch 
 and singled to left-center field to score Jose Reyes and break a 2-2 tie
 .\n\nThe Mets added to their lead when Mike Cameron hit what appeared to
  be a single up the middle\, but Cameron stretched it into a double afte
 r he saw center fielder Brad Wilkerson not running hard after the ball. 
 Offerman scored on the play.\n\nCarlos Beltran followed and singled to l
 eft to send Cameron home.\n\n\"It was just bad luck\,\" Kim said. \"Ther
 e were many groundball hits.\"\n\nThe winning pitcher was Roberto Hernan
 dez\, while Kim took the loss.\n\n\"Kim didn't pitch that badly in the n
 inth inning. You have to give the [opposing] team a little credit some t
 ime\,\" Robinson said. \"In the ninth inning\, we acted like the sun had
  kind of gotten to us a little bit out there defensively.\"\n\nJohn Patt
 erson started for the Nationals\, and he was solid for six-plus innings\
 , giving up two runs on four hits. He struck out seven batters and walke
 d two. Patterson threw 116 pitches\, and 74 of them went for strikes.\n\
 nThe Nationals gave Patterson a 1-0 lead in the second inning off New Yo
 rk starter Kaz Ishii. Vinny Castilla started the inning off with a doubl
 e. Two outs later\, Junior Spivey doubled to left-center field to drive 
 in Castilla.\n\nJose Guillen made it a two-run game when he doubled to l
 eft-center field to drive in Jamey Carroll from first base.\n\nBut the M
 ets tied the score in the top of the seventh inning. Patterson left the 
 game after giving up a single to Marlon Anderson and a double to David W
 right to put runners on second and third.\n\nLuis Ayala entered the game
  and gave up a single to Reyes to score Anderson and make it a 2-1 game.
 \n\nAfter Chris Woodward bounced into a fielder's choice and pinch-hitte
 r Brian Daubach struck out\, Cameron hit a broken-bat single to center t
 o score Reyes.\n\n\"I would have liked to stay in the ballgame\, but bri
 nging Ayala out of the 'pen was the right decision\,\" Patterson said. \
 "He comes in and gets out of the jams all the time.\"\n\nRobinson would 
 have loved for Patterson to go seven innings because of the team's bullp
 en situation\, but the manager felt Patterson threw too many pitches.\n\
 n\"When the first two men got on\, what am I supposed to do? He has to r
 each back and try to get more\,\" Robinson said. \"I didn't want him to 
 do that and I didn't want him to throw any more pitches. If he had a 1-2
 -3 inning in a reasonable amount of pitches\, that would have been fine.
  After he allowed two runners on base\, I said\, 'I might as well get hi
 m out of there before things get ugly.'\"\n\nPatterson now has nine no-d
 ecisions\, and he said it is frustrating not getting wins.\n\n\"It's get
 ting a little frustrating\, but you have to keep going out there throwin
 g the ball the way I'm throwing it\,\" Patterson said.\n\nThis story was

SUMMARY:(L) vs Marlins
DESCRIPTION:Loss: 2-4\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- Natio
 nals manager Frank Robinson said that his bullpen was rested because rig
 ht-handers John Patterson\, Esteban Loaiza and Livan Hernandez pitched d
 eep into their games. It's a good thing\, too\, because\, on Tuesday\, R
 obinson used five relievers\, who held Florida to one run in 6 1/3 innin
 gs.\nBut the Marlins did their damage in the third inning and it helped 
 them defeat the Nationals\, 4-2\, in front of 24\,936 at Robert F. Kenne
 dy Stadium. The loss snapped Washington's three-game winning streak.\n\n
 The loss dropped the Nationals 2 1/2 games behind the Astros in the Wild
  Card race.\n\nRight-hander Darrell Rasner made his Major League debut b
 ecause of a shoulder injury to Tony Armas Jr. Rasner handled the Marlins
  the first two innings\, but he couldn't complete the third as the Marli
 ns scored three runs. Rasner struggled with his curveball and the Marlin
 s took advantage of the situation.\n\nLuis Castillo drove in Damion Easl
 ey with a single to center\, then scored all the way from first on a dou
 ble by Jeremy Hermida. Two batters later\, Hermida scored on a double by
  Juan Encarnacion.\n\n\"My stuff wasn't as sharp as it was the first two
  innings\,\" Rasner said. \"I really didn't have good command of my curv
 eball and that came back to get me. If I have that going\, I'm a little 
 more successful. I just didn't have it tonight. I would have liked to be
  better\, but I have to take the positives and go from there.\"\n\nDespi
 te Rasner's less-than-stellar performance\, the bullpen kept the Nationa
 ls in the game. Reliever Gary Majewski\, who pitched one shutout inning\
 , said Ranser was put in a tough situation to perform in a pennant race.
 \n\n\"It's that point and time that there is no room for error\,\" Majew
 ski said. \"I was talking to [bullpen coach Bob] Natal in the bullpen an
 d it's really tough to have the kid make his Major League debut and try 
 to perform in a pennant race. It was one of those things where it was a 
 short night because we are trying to win and stick to our strengths.\"\n
 \nWhile the bullpen held its own\, the position players were unable to d
 o much against three pitchers not named Dontrelle Willis\, Josh Beckett 
 or A.J. Burnett.\n\nIsmael Valdez started for the Marlins and the Nation
 als continued to have problems with pitchers who are not aces. Valdez en
 tered with just one quality start this season. He went on to pitch five 
 solid innings\, giving up two runs on three hits.\n\n\"Valdez threw stri
 kes tonight\,\" said left fielder Marlon Byrd. \"We got ourselves out. T
 hat's a guy we have to beat\, especially with the arms coming behind the
 m. We kept hitting the ball right at people. He just threw the ball over
  the plate. He made the pitches when he had to. We made aggressive swing
 s and the ball didn't fall for us.\"\n\nThe only damage that was done to
  Valdez was in the bottom of the third inning\, when Brad Wilkerson hit 
 a two-run home run to make it a 3-2 game.\n\n\"I was frustrated\, becaus
 e\, after they gave me the lead\, I almost blew it\,\" Valdez said. \"Bu
 t I was able to control my temper\, and get my rhythm and went another f
 ew innings.\"\n\nIn the fifth inning\, Castillo made it a two-run game a
 gain when he homered off Mike Stanton. Castillo ended up going 3-for-4 w
 ith two runs scored.\n\nAfter Valdez left the game\, Brian Moehler and T
 odd Jones shut out the Nationals the rest of the way with Jones picking 
 up his 35th save of the season.\n\nThe Nationals will face Willis on Wed
 nesday\, and they have had problems with him over the years. He is 7-2 w
 ith a 2.59 ERA against them.\n\n\"We expected to win tonight and it's go
 ing to be a tough one tomorrow\,\" Byrd said.\n\nThis story was not subj

 - The Mets scored three runs in the top of the ninth inning and defeated
  the Nationals\, 6-3\, in front of 27\,333 fans at Robert F. Kennedy Sta

  bases loaded with no outs when Miguel Cairo hit a sacrifice fly to scor
 e Eric Valent. Carlos Beltran followed with a two-run double to make it 
 6-3.\n\nAyala took the loss\, while Roberto Hernandez earned the win and
  Braden Looper earned his fourth save of the season.\n\nThe Nationals' l
 oss was minor compared to what happened in the seventh inning. Reliever 
 Joey Eischen left the game with a broken right arm. He will have surgery
  on Monday and miss eight to 12 weeks. Dr. Wiemi Douoguih\, the team ort
 hopedic physician\, will perform the surgery.\n\nEischen is the sixth Na
 tionals pitcher this season to land on the disabled list.\n\n\"It's a bi
 g loss for our clubhouse. A lot of the guys who have been around\, have 
 to pick it up and go out there and play good baseball\,\" outfielder Bra
 d Wilkerson said. \"He's the only lefty we have in our bullpen. We are g
 oing to have to fill it some way\, somehow.\"\n\nMets second baseman Kaz
 uo Matsui\, pinch-hitting for Aaron Heilman\, led off the seventh by hit
 ting a chopper toward the pitcher's mound. Eischen\, who replaced Patter
 son to start the inning\, dove and caught it on one hop\, fell down hard
  to the ground and laid on the ground in pain for several minutes before
  being helped off the field by Douoguih. Eischen said he heard a pop the
  moment that he hit the ground.\n\nNationals starter John Patterson had

 id.\n\nRobinson feels that the turning point of the game occurred in the
  top of the fourth\, when Patterson couldn't hold a 3-1 lead. In that in
 ning\, Cliff Floyd made it a 3-2 game by driving in Beltran with a doubl
 e. Floyd then scored the tying run on a single by David Wright.\n\n\"Whe

 to shut the other team down and get back in the dugout\,\" Robinson said
 . \"If you let them score and let them come back the way they did\, that
  gives the opposing pitcher a lot more confidence. They may not say it\,
  but you are a little down.\"\n\nPatterson said he was pleased with the 
 way he battled on the mound.\n\n\"I didn't have my best command. I gave 
 my team a chance to win\,\" he said.\n\nPatterson's counterpart\, Aaron 
 Heilman\, had similar numbers. He also gave up three runs in six innings

DESCRIPTION:Loss: 3-6\n\nBy Jeff Seidel / Special to MLB.com\n\nWASHINGT
 ON\, D.C. -- Washington manager Frank Robinson said before Tuesday's gam
 e that giving the ball to starter Livan Hernandez lets him relax a littl
 e because of how well the right-hander can throw.\n\nBut Robinson didn't
  get to take it easy for long as Florida batted around in the third inni
 ng to score five runs off Hernandez. The right-hander never hit his stri
 de and left after five innings as the Marlins recorded a 6-3 victory and
  completed a two-game sweep of Washington before 25\,990 at RFK Stadium.
 \n\nHernandez (1-2) was upset early in the game with home plate umpire M
 arvin Hudson's strike zone\, and Robinson said Hernandez was a little to
 o worried about that and it proved costly.\n\n\"He had good stuff tonigh
 t\; he had a good fastball and a good breaking ball\,\" Robinson said. \
 "But I think that [disagreement] affected his mental state. He lost his 
 focus a little.\"\n\nHernandez gave up one run on five hits in seven str
 ong innings during the team's 3-2 win in Miami on April 9. But he strugg
 led through five innings Tuesday\, giving up six runs on eight hits\, wa
 lking two without a strikeout.\n\n\"I tried to throw outside\, and the u
 mpire wasn't calling it\,\" Hernandez said. \"I tried my best\, but it's
  not my day. It happens sometimes.\"\n\nHernandez didn't look for other 
 causes\, waving off questions about the mound possibly being too soft\, 
 as others had mentioned in the first games in Washington.\n\n\"There's n
 o mound situation\,\" Hernandez said with a smile. \"There's a Livan sit
 uation.\"\n\nThe middle of the Florida lineup got to Hernandez and the N
 ationals' bullpen\, combining for seven hits and all the RBIs. Carlos De
 lgado (2-for-4\, two RBIs)\, Miguel Cabrera (2-for-5\, one RBI)\, Juan E
 ncarnacion (2-for-3\, one RBI) and Paul LoDuca (1-for-3\, two RBIs) batt
 ed third\, fourth\, fifth and sixth\, and the quartet did damage all nig
 ht\, starting in the second inning.\n\nFlorida starter Brian Moehler wal
 ked with one out in the third\, starting the rally. Delgado tied the gam
 e at 1-1 later with a sacrifice fly\, followed by Cabrera's RBI single f
 or a 2-1 lead. Encarnacion then added an RBI single before LoDuca broke 
 things open with a two-run single to left for a 5-1 lead. Delgado later 
 contributed a booming solo homer to right off Hernandez in the fifth.\n\
 nHernandez said the walk to Moehler proved crucial and the Marlins simpl
 y waited for good pitches to hit.\n\n\"I think we were a little bit more
  patient\,\" Delgado said. \"I think he didn't have as good of command a
 s he did last time at our place.\"\n\nMoehler (1-0) allowed one run on s
 ix hits in five innings and earned his first win as a Marlin.\n\nWashing
 ton wasted a number of scoring chances. Hernandez drove in one run with 
 a second-inning squeeze bunt\, catcher Brian Schneider homered to right 
 in the eighth\, and Nick Johnson added an RBI single in the ninth. But t
 he Nationals finished with 10 hits and left 10 on base\, including stran
 ding runners in scoring position in five innings.\n\nOn the bright side 
 for the Nats\, Cristian Guzman finally broke out of his season-long slum
 p. Entering the game with a .106 average\, Guzman singled in his first t
 wo at-bats before doubling on his third and finishing 3-for-4.\n\nThe ga
 me proved costly for Washington\, though\, as relief pitcher T.J. Tucker
  left in the sixth inning with a right groin strain. Club officials said
  he'd be out two to four weeks. Vinny Castilla fouled a ball off his shi
 n in the sixth\, and Robinson removed him in the seventh.\n\nCastilla sa
 id after the game that he'd be ready for the first game of the Atlanta s
 eries on Wednesday.\n\nThe Nationals now have lost two consecutive games
  after reeling off five wins in a row and jumping into first place in th
 e National League East. Washington and Florida are tied at 8-6.\n\nRobin
 son doesn't want a small losing streak to build into something bigger. H
 e's considering making some lineup moves\, possibly with center fielder 
 Ryan Church\, who struck out twice and is batting only .161. But as Robi
 nson cautioned a few times\, it's early in the season.\n\nThe main thing
  Robinson wants is some quality starting pitching. The manager is a big 
 believer in fundamentals and good pitching helping to take care of every
 thing.\n\n\"You have to have patience\; that's the way this game is\,\" 
 Robinson said. \"If you're playing football\, you'd be in trouble right 
 now. But you're not playing football\, thank goodness.\"\n\nThis story w

DESCRIPTION:Win: 5-2\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nLOS ANGELES -- Livan
  Hernandez completed his first game of the season and helped the Nationa
 ls defeat the Dodgers\, 5-2\, in front of 30\,081 fans on Wednesday nigh
 t.\nHernandez (4-2) gave up two runs on seven hits. He struck out four b
 atters and walked three. Hernandez now has 41 compete games in his caree
 r. Even more important\, he gave the bullpen\, which is a man short\, th
 e day off.\n\n\"I thought I would never get the first complete game this
  year\,\" Hernandez said. \"I see quite a few pitchers have [two] alread
 y. I don't want to stay behind those guys. I want to go for nine innings
 . Now I'm good\, so let's see what I do the next game.\"\n\nThe only tim
 e Hernandez found himself in serious trouble was in the fifth inning. Wi
 th the score tied at one\, the Dodgers had the bases loaded and two outs
 \, but Hernandez was able to get Hee-Seop Choi to pop up to third base t
 o end the threat.\n\n\"Livan gave us a gusty ballgame\,\" manager Frank 
 Robinson said. \"He had some very good defensive plays behind him with s
 ome timely hitting. There were a lot of heroes who contributed to the vi
 ctory tonight.\"\n\nOn defense\, shortstop Cristian Guzman and third bas
 eman Vinny Castilla were the heroes. Their fielding gems came in the sev
 enth and eighth innings\, respectively.\n\nIn the seventh\, with Ricky L
 edee at second\, Jason Phillips hit the ball between short and third. Gu
 zman backhanded the ball at deep short and nipped Phillips at first base
 .\n\nAn inning later\, the Dodgers had runners on first and third with t
 he tying run at the plate. Milton Bradley hit a slow roller down the thi
 rd-base line. Castilla one-handed the ball and threw a perfect strike to
  Jamey Carroll at second base for the force to end the inning.\n\n\"When
  I turned and saw him look at me\, I realized I was the only play he had
 \,\" Carroll said of Castilla. \"I continued to the bag. He made a perfe
 ct throw.\"\n\nWith the great defense the Nationals have\, Hernandez fee
 ls he can throw the ball down in the strike zone and get his share of gr
 oundball outs.\n\n\"I have good defense behind me\,\" Hernandez said. \"
 These guys are amazing. It was good for me because it saved me a couple 
 of runs.\"\n\nHernandez fell behind\, 1-0\, in the fourth inning\, when 
 J.D. Drew drove in Cesar Izturis with a groundout to second base. But th
 e hitting heroes would come out and give Hernandez the run support he ne
 eded to win the game.\n\nOdalis Perez\, a left-hander that Nationals int
 erim general manager Jim Bowden coveted most of the offseason\, was Hern
 andez's counterpart. Perez pitched 6 1/3 innings and gave up five runs o
 n seven hits.\n\nThe Nationals tied the score at one off Perez when Nick
  Johnson hit his third home run of the season over the right-field wall 
 in the fifth inning.\n\nThe Nationals then broke it open in the seventh 
 by scoring four runs. Jose Vidro scored all the way from first base on a
  double by Castilla\, who advanced to third base on an error by second b
 aseman Jeff Kent.\n\nJohnson followed with a single to right to drive in
  Castilla. After he advanced to third base on a hit-and-run single by Je
 ffrey Hammonds\, Johnson scored on a sacrifice fly by Gary Bennett.\n\nH
 ernandez helped himself by hitting a bloop single to left-center field t
 hat drove in Hammonds.\n\nThe victory means the Nationals won the three-
 game series. It's their fifth series win of the season. The Nationals up
  their record to 15-13\, while the Dodgers drop to 17-10.\n\nThe win als
 o comes a day after they played one of their worst games of the season. 
 In that 4-2 loss on Tuesday\, the Nationals made several baserunning gaf
 fes and right-hander Zach Day showed up Robinson on the mound. Robinson 
 said he loves the way the team can bounce back and play with a lot of he
 art.\n\n\"You ask me if I know this team inside and out -- no. I'm still
  learning. I'm still opened minded\,\" Robinson said. \"I'm still surpri
 sed by some of the things they do. I'm very proud of this team so far\, 
 and I know we haven't played very many games. But I'm very proud of the 
 heart these guys show out there on the field. They are able to bounce ba
 ck from bad ballgames. They come out the next day and it's like they're 
 starting out fresh and nothing happened the day before. That's a good ap
 proach.\"\n\nThis story was not subject to the approval of Major League

DESCRIPTION:make-up for the rainout on 8/16/05\n\nLoss: 1-2\n\nBy Bill L
 adson / MLB.com\n\nPHILADELPHIA -- The Nationals' offense struggled agai
 n as they were nipped by the Phillies\, 2-1\, in front of 30\,046 fans i
 n the first game of a day-night doubleheader Thursday.\nThe Nationals go
 t off to a good start against right-hander Vicente Padilla in the second
  inning. With the bases loaded and no outs\, Cristian Guzman singled to 
 center field to drive in Preston Wilson and give the Nationals a 1-0 lea
 d. But Washington was unable to do anything else after that.\n\nNational
 s starter Tony Armas was the next hitter and he struck out. Brad Wilkers
 on followed and flied out to left field\, while Jose Vidro grounded out 
 to end the inning.\n\n\"We can't get anybody to stick their nose in ther
 e and get a tough base hit on a consistent basis and get that big fly ba
 ll\,\" manager Frank Robinson said. \"We had opportunities to break the 
 game open\, as far as I'm concerned\, and we are not doing it. We are no
 t getting the tough base hit.\"\n\nAs for Armas\, he got off to a rough 
 start. He had four walks by the third inning and found himself in jams i
 n the first and third innings. It didn't help that Armas had problems co
 ntrolling his fastball.\n\nIn the first\, with two outs\, Armas walked t
 hree consecutive batters before striking out Ryan Howard to end the inni
 ng.\n\nIn the third\, Armas wasn't so lucky. The Phillies took a 2-1 lea
 d when Bobby Abreu doubled home Jimmy Rollins and Kenny Lofton.\n\nStill
 \, Armas pitched five-plus innings and gave up only two runs on five hit
 s. He struck out three and walked six.\n\n\"Overall\, he was good\,\" Ro
 binson said. \"He made the pitches and got hitters out\, especially all 
 those hitters he put out there for free. It's unbelievable that he gave 
 up only two runs. We wished he would have had a cleaner outing so he cou
 ld have stayed out there a little longer. Under the circumstances\, he d
 id a fine job.\"\n\nThe Nationals had opportunities to tie the score in 
 the sixth and seventh innings.\n\nIn the sixth\, with Padilla still on t
 he mound\, the Nationals had runners on first and second and no outs. Vi
 nny Castilla hit a slow ground ball to second baseman Chase Utley. Wilso
 n tried to knock Utley down between first and second to prevent him from
  completing the double play. Wilson managed to block Utley down low\, bu
 t Utley was able to throw out Castilla.\n\n\"I wish I could have hit him
  a little bit higher\, but I was into my running a little bit\,\" Wilson
  said. \"I hit him low. Maybe if I could have hit him a little higher\, 
 I would have knocked him off balance. That's the most you could hope for
  on that play.\n\n\"It's one of those plays where Vinny has a bad knee. 
 That's a factor there. But Utley did a good job of staying with it and c
 ompleting the play.\"\n\nGary Bennett followed and struck out to end the
  inning.\n\nCastilla\, who is having a tough season and proving to criti
 cs once again that he struggles outside of Coors Field\, said he is disa
 ppointed that the Nationals can't get the big hit when they need it in t
 he second half.\n\nThe Nationals were 24-9 in one-run games in the first
  half\, but are just 1-14 in the same category on the second half.\n\n\"
 All the games we were winning in the first half\, we are losing in the s
 econd half. If we are going to make a run\, we have to start winning tho
 se games again\,\" Castilla said.\n\nIn the seventh\, with Ryan Madson o
 n the mound\, Wilkerson stretched a single into a double with two outs\,
  but Vidro grounded out to end the inning.\n\nIt appears the Nationals a
 re going to the batter's box without a game plan\, which hitting coach T
 om McCraw has preached all year long.\n\n\"They are certainly given a pl
 an to go up there and attack a pitcher in certain situations. But whethe
 r or not they are locked into it\, I don't know\,\" Robinson said.\n\nTh

SUMMARY:(W) vs Braves
DESCRIPTION:Win: 8-6\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- Gary B
 ennett drove in a career-high-tying five runs and helped the Nationals c
 ome back from a three-run deficit to defeat the Braves\, 8-6\, in front 
 of 29\,225 at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium on Thursday night.\nThe National
 s won the series\, 3-1\, and find themselves 1 1/2 games behind the Brav
 es and Marlins\, who are in a first-place tie in the National League Eas
 t.\n\nAfter the Braves scored four runs in the top of the eighth inning 
 to take a 6-3 lead\, Nationals outfielder Jose Guillen came into the dug
 out very upset that his team was not playing good fundamental baseball. 
 He told his teammates\, \"Let's go. We can come back.\"\n\n\"I care so m
 uch about winning\,\" Guillen said. \"I respect all my teammates\, but i
 n the last few days we have been giving the Braves opportunities to come
  back and get runs they should not be getting. As players\, we are not h
 ere to play six or seven innings. We are here to play nine innings and b
 e smart.\"\n\nGuillen's talk in the dugout paid off\, as the Nationals r
 allied in the bottom of the eighth inning off two Braves relievers.\n\nW
 ith runners on first and second\, one out and Danny Kolb on the mound\, 
 Carlos Baerga singled to right field to drive in Jamey Carroll and make 
 it a 6-4 game.\n\nVinny Castilla followed and doubled down the right-fie
 ld line to score Guillen and make it a one-run game.\n\nReliever Kevin G
 ryboski came into the game\, and after Marlon Byrd was walked intentiona
 lly\, Bennett doubled in three runs to give the Nationals the 8-6 lead.\
 n\nThe last time he drove in five runs in a game was on Sept. 20\, 2003\
 , against the Rockies.\n\n\"I just got the barrel on a couple of pitches
  and it worked out\,\" said a modest Bennett\, who went 2-for-4 in the g
 ame. \"I was just trying to hit the ball hard and it worked out for us t
 onight. It seems like there is somebody doing something different all th
 e time\, and I think that's what keeps us rolling. We are not relying on
  one guy. We are trying to do our part. So far\, it's working out OK for
  us.\"\n\nBennett's hitting has been a bonus for the Nationals. He was s
 igned to bring solid defense behind the plate. But after Thursday's acti
 on\, Bennett is hitting .267 with a home run and 13 RBIs. The RBI total 
 is one more than starting catcher Brian Schneider. Asked if he should be
  platooning with Schneider\, Bennett said that Schneider should continue
  to be the everyday catcher.\n\n\"I knew full well Brian would be the No
 . 1 guy. and I'm here as his fill in\,\" Bennett said. \"It is what it i
 s\, and that's what it's going to be throughout. Barring any injury\, an
 d hopefully we don't have anything like that\, he's the No. 1 catcher. I
 'm here to spell him and give him days off so he could stay strong throu
 ghout the season.\"\n\nThe winning pitcher was Hector Carrasco\, while K
 olb took the loss. Chad Cordero picked up his 14th save\, matching the t
 otal he set last season as a rookie.\n\nIt was the second time Washingto
 n rallied for a win against Kolb. On April 12\, the Nationals scored thr
 ee runs in the top of the ninth inning off Kolb to defeat the Braves\, 4
 -3\, in Atlanta.\n\nAs for manager Frank Robinson\, he is already lookin
 g ahead to the three-game series against the Marlins which starts on Fri
 day\, and he feels that the Nationals must play better in that series. T
 hey are 1-4 against the Marlins this season.\n\n\"The Marlins are a good
  ballclub\, because these guys can run on you\, bunt on you\, club you a
 nd outpitch you to death if you don't go out there and do some damage yo
 urself\,\" he said.\n\nIt looked like Nationals starter Esteban Loaiza w
 as going to pick up his second win of the season\, but he ended up with 
 his seventh no-decision. Loaiza pitched six solid innings and gave up tw
 o runs on five hits. He struck out seven and walked two.\n\nLoaiza was g
 iven a 2-0 lead in the bottom of the second inning\, when Bennett hit a 
 two-run home run off Braves starter Horacio Ramirez.\n\nAfter Wilson Bet
 emit scored on a Brayan Pena groundout in the bottom of the fifth inning
  to cut the lead by one\, Loaiza helped himself in the bottom of the inn
 ing. He led off with a double. After advancing to third base on a Brad W
 ilkerson grounder\, Loaiza scored on Carroll's sacrifice fly.\n\nThe Bra
 ves made it a 3-2 game off Loaiza when Adam LaRoche singled to drive in 
 Marcus Giles.\n\n\"It's all about winning\, though\,\" Loaiza said. \"I 
 went out there\, battled and kept the team in the game. I left with the 
 lead. You just never know what could happen in the game. Hopefully these
  wins for me can come around. But the most important thing is keeping th
 e team in the game and have them win in the end.\"\n\nThe Nationals' bul
 lpen unraveled for the second game in a row\, and Washington also blunde
 red on defense in the top of the eighth.\n\nThe Braves turned the tables
  on reliever Gary Majewski.\n\nAndruw Jones tied the score at 3-3 when h
 e drove in Ryan Langerhans with a sacrifice to left field.\n\nWith two o
 uts\, Majewski couldn't get anybody out. Brian Jordan hit a grounder up 
 the middle. Cristian Guzman grabbed the ball and threw the ball away to 
 put runners on second and third. After Betemit was walked intentionally\
 , Pena singled up the middle to drive in two runs On the same play\, Wil
 kerson's throwing error allowed Betemit to score.\n\nNationals first bas
 eman Nick Johnson left the game after seven innings because of chest pai
 ns.\n\nThe initial diagnosis was that Johnson was suffering from reflux\
 , though he will have further tests taken.\n\nJohnson had difficulty tak
 ing deep breaths and was taken to the hospital for observation.\n\nThis

SUMMARY:(L) vs Rockies
DESCRIPTION:Loss: 4-5\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- Being
  that they are in a pennant race\, the Nationals are supposed to beat a 
 last-place club like the Rockies. Instead\, the Rockies took care of the
  Nationals\, who lost Monday's game\, 5-4\, in front of 30\,165 at Rober
 t F. Kennedy Stadium.\nThe Nationals have now lost nine of their last 12
  games and find their lead in the National League East dwindling by the 
 day.\n\nFor at least two weeks the Nationals' offense has been virtually
  nonexistent\, but on Monday it was their defense that fell apart.\n\nVi
 nny Castilla's error in ninth proved most costly. With the score tied at
  4 and closer Chad Cordero one strike away from getting out of the innin
 g\, Aaron Miles hit a routine groundball to Castilla at third base. But 
 the ball went under Castilla's glove for an error and allowed Eddy Garab
 ito to score from second base.\n\nCastilla has been playing with a bad l
 eft knee for most of the season\, but he said it did not force him into 
 the error.\n\n\"I just missed the ball\,\" Castilla said. \"That's it. I
 t's surprising because I always make those plays. When something goes ba
 d\, it's bad.\"\n\nThe losing pitcher was Cordero\, while Jose Acevedo e
 arned the victory and Brian Fuentes picked up his 13th save.\n\nThere we
 re defensive lapses that cost the Nationals earlier in the game\, as wel
 l.\n\nIn the fifth inning\, Castilla made a throwing error that allowed 
 Dustan Mohr to go to second base. Mohr would later score on a Cory Sulli
 van triple.\n\nThe next inning\, Cristian Guzman had a shot to get Todd 
 Helton at the plate\, but he booted Garrett Atkins' grounder\, allowing 
 Helton to score and help the Rockies take a 3-2 lead.\n\n\"It's the wors
 t game we played all year long\,\" manager Frank Robinson said. \"It's u
 nacceptable and it will not be acceptable here. We have been making slop
 py plays that cost us runs in ballgames for quite some time\, but it cam
 e to a head tonight. I'm not going to accept that.\"\n\nThe box score sa
 id the Nationals made three errors in the game\, but they made many more
  mistakes on Monday.\n\nGuzman appeared to forgot how to bunt. In the se
 cond inning\, after Brian Schneider led off with a single\, Guzman tried
  to bunt\, but he popped it up and the Rockies were able to double off S
 chneider at first base.\n\nSchneider led off again with a single in the 
 eighth inning\, but Guzman struck out making a bunt attempt.\n\n\"They w
 ere throwing me a slider\, fastball\,\" Guzman said. \"What can I say?\"
 \n\nWhen asked how dishearting it was that Guzman couldn't lay down a bu
 nt\, Robinson said\, \"I wish my vocabulary would better describe [those
  situations]. But it's not\, so I'll leave it as it is.\"\n\nPreston Wil
 son thought he should have caught Sullivan's triple. Wilson was playing 
 shallow center field\, but Sullivan caught Wilson off guard by hitting t
 he ball over his head.\n\n\"He hit pretty decently and it kept carrying.
  I went back and the ball caught the heel of the glove\,\" Wilson said.\
 n\nEven Jamey Carroll\, the man Robinson calls the most fundamentally so
 und player on the Nationals\, made a mistake. With runners on first and 
 second in bottom of the ninth inning\, Carroll took Fuentes' first pitch
  and hit into a double play to end the game\, which didn't please Robins
 on. Carroll is best known for taking a lot of pitches.\n\n\"It was right
  there and I hit it on the ground\,\" Carroll said. \"I knew he was tryi
 ng to get ahead in that situation. He came right after me. It was a pret
 ty good pitch. I hit the top of the ball and grounded out.\"\n\nOutfield
 er Jose Guillen is optimistic that the Nationals will have some good for
 tune soon.\n\n\"Hopefully\, we are going to catch a break\, like everyth
 ing is going to go our way\,\" Guillen said. \"Right now\, nothing is go
 ing our way. That's baseball and you are not always going to have a good
  time.\"\n\nNationals starter Tony Armas Jr. didn't get past the third i
 nning\, as he left the game because of dizziness and dehydration. Before
  he left\, he gave up a run in the first inning as Eric Byrnes drove in 
 Miles with a single.\n\nBut the Nationals took a 2-1 lead in the bottom 
 of the first off starter Byung-Hyun Kim. Wilson drove Jose Vidro home wi
 th a blooped double\, while Guillen scored on a Ryan Church groundout.\n
 \nAfter the Rockies made it a 4-2 game\, the Nationals found themselves 
 back in it with Rockies reliever Mike DeJean on the mound. With the base
 s loaded and one out\, Church hit a sacrifice fly which sent Vidro home\
 , and Sullivan's throw in center field skipped past Atkins at third base
 \, allowing Guillen to score the tying run.\n\nThis story was not subjec

SUMMARY:(W) vs Athletics
DESCRIPTION:InterLeague\n\nWin: 2-1\n\nBy Pete Kerzel / Special to MLB.c
 om\n\nWASHINGTON -- Nick Johnson's decisive home run will get all the ac
 claim for allowing the Washington Nationals to continue their impressive
  winning streak.\nHis game-saving scoop on an inning-ending double play\
 , however\, is destined to get lost in the box score.\n\nOn a night when
  the National League East-leading Nationals stretched their winning stre
 ak to a season-high five games -- moving six games above .500 for the fi
 rst time since the Montreal Expos were 71-65 on Aug. 29\, 2003 -- the cl
 ub's most dependable hitter was steady at the plate and in the field in 
 a 2-1 Interleague victory over the Oakland Athletics.\n\n\"I'd like to s
 core some more runs. ... We need to come out [and score]. We can't alway
 s do that\,\" said Johnson\, whose two-run shot with none out in the six
 th was the difference.\n\nThe \"that\" Johnson refers to is the National
 s' penchant for dramatic come-from-behind wins\, often resulting in one-
 run margins of victory. Washington is 7-1 on its current 13-game homesta
 nd\, and in each of those triumphs\, the Nationals trailed and rallied.\
 n\nOverall\, 22 of their 32 wins are of the comeback variety\, while the
  Nationals have gone 10-5 in one-run games since May 8.\n\nManager Frank
  Robinson can't explain why his club seems to sleepwalk through the earl
 y innings\, then suddenly accelerate when they have little room for erro
 r. But as long as the Nationals keep winning\, he isn't likely to argue 
 the point.\n\n\"I don't know what it is and I'm not going to tamper with
  it\,\" Robinson said. \"We're having success\, so we'll leave it alone.
  But it's certainly not easy on the stomach.\"\n\nTrue to their recent f
 orm\, the Nationals struggled early against Oakland\, a team that has no
 w dropped nine straight on the road\, and starter Barry Zito\, a once-do
 minant starter who fell to 0-5 on the road and is hardly assuming the ro
 le of staff ace with the departure of Mark Mulder to St. Louis and Tim H
 udson to Atlanta.\n\nStaked to a 1-0 lead after a run-scoring double by 
 Scott Hatteberg in the first inning\, Zito (2-7) cruised through five in
 nings\, displaying an overwhelming curve. He allowed Washington only thr
 ee hits over that span.\n\nThen came the sixth\, when Jose Guillen\, ret
 urning to the Washington lineup after missing Sunday's game with a sore 
 hand\, drew a leadoff walk. That brought Johnson -- who has reached base
  in 55 of his 57 games -- to the plate.\n\nJohnson\, who hit only seven 
 homers last year in an injury-shortened season\, notched his eighth of t
 he year on Zito's first pitch. He crushed a two-run homer to the gap in 
 right-center\, putting Washington ahead\, 2-1.\n\n\"Maybe they just don'
 t feel like they want to put too much effort out there and do too much w
 ork when they can get it done in half a ballgame\,\" Robinson said\, onl
 y half-jokingly.\n\nJohnson wasn't hunting a specific pitch -- unless yo
 u count one over the plate as his intended quarry.\n\n\"[Zito] threw fou
 r balls and I was just looking for a pitch in the zone to swing at\,\" J
 ohnson said. \"I feel pretty good\, I'm seeing the ball well. But I've g
 ot to keep grinding every at-bat.\"\n\nJohnson\, who is 14-for-25 (.560)
  with eight runs scored and seven RBIs on the homestand\, is certainly d
 oing that. But he flashed his defensive prowess in the eighth\, when Rob
 inson had to use three pitchers to blunt an Oakland rally.\n\nHector Car
 rasco relieved starter Tony Armas Jr. (2-3) and got Jason Kendall to gro
 und out to short. With two left-handed hitters looming\, Robinson called
  for lefty C..J. Nitkowski\, who promptly surrendered a single to Eric C
 havez and walked Hatteberg.\n\nLuis Ayala replaced Nitkowski and got Bob
 by Crosby to bounce into a rally-ending 6-4-3 double play. But second ba
 seman Jamey Carroll's relay to Johnson bounced a bit wide of first\, for
 cing Johnson to make a nice scoop to protect the lead.\n\n\"That was a t
 ough one\,\" Johnson said. \"I was thinking [I had to] get the out\, bec
 ause if it gets by me\, it's a tie ballgame.\"\n\n\"What we've got him o
 ut there for is his glove\,\" Robinson said of Johnson. \"That was a pre
 tty good play. It gets us out of the inning.\"\n\nJohnson made sure a gu
 tsy effort by Armas was rewarded. Armas labored through six innings on a
  humid 91-degree evening\, never really getting command of his pitches b
 ut never really giving in either.\n\n\"Sometimes it's easy and sometimes
  it isn't\,\" said Armas\, who allowed four hits\, walked one and struck
  out two for his first victory since May 16. \"I've got to pitch my way 
 through things.\"\n\nChad Cordero\, the sixth Washington pitcher\, worke
 d the ninth for his 16th save in 18 chances. But he also had to get out 
 of trouble after allowing two-out singles to Marco Scutaro and Eric Byrn
 es before Mark Kotsay bounced out to Carroll.\n\nThis story was not subj

DESCRIPTION:Loss: 2-3\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nPHOENIX -- Right-ha
 nder Tony Armas Jr. had one bad inning and it cost him as the Diamondbac
 ks edged the Nationals\, 3-2\, in front of 23\,181 fans at Bank One Ball
 park on Tuesday night.\nArmas\, who was making his season debut after mi
 ssing six weeks because of a tight right groin\, had a 2-0 lead and was 
 cruising until the sixth inning\, when the Diamondbacks scored their thr
 ee runs.\n\nWith runners on first and third and two outs\, Troy Glaus to
 ok a 3-0 pitch and hit the ball in the picnic area in center field for a
  three-run home run. The ball traveled 430 feet. Armas said he was a lit
 tle surprised that he swung at the pitch. \"I guess I have to know him a
  little better\,\" he said.\n\nArmas\, however\, felt the key of the inn
 ing was walking pinch-hitter Quinton McCracken on five pitches. Armas wo
 uld then get the next two hitters out before giving up the walk to Luis 
 Gonzalez and home run to Glaus.\n\n\"The hitter that hurt me the most wa
 s McCracken. I should have went after him. I made some pitches and he di
 dn't go for it\,\" Armas said.\n\nArmas ended up pitching 5 2/3 innings 
 and gave up three runs on three hits. He struck out two batters and walk
 ed three. Manager Frank Robinson was pleased with Armas' performance.\n\
 n\"Armas was great\,\" Robinson said. \"He went after the hitters in the
  strike zone. The breaking balls were sharp\, control was very good. He 
 threw a minimum amount of pitches until he hit the wall in the sixth inn
 ing. It was a very good.\"\n\nSaid second baseman Carlos Baerga\, fillin
 g in for the injured Jose Vidro\, \"It was good to see Armas pitch. We n
 ow know that we have four good starters. It makes you feel good about th
 e staff.\"\n\nTuesday's outing was Armas' first Major League appearance 
 since Sept. 12\, and he expressed his happiness about being able to pitc
 h on a big league mound again.\n\n\"I was confident. I wanted to get tha
 t first out in the first inning. I wanted it to get out of my mind. Ever
 ything went pretty well\,\" he said.\n\nThe Nationals had plenty of oppo
 rtunities to win the game for the Armas. They had the bases loaded three
  times in the game and were unable to score. Overall\, the Nationals lef
 t 13 men on base.\n\nIn the fourth inning\, they had the bases loaded wi
 th two outs against starter Shawn Estes\, but Jeffery Hammonds struck ou
 t looking to end the inning.\n\nIn the sixth\, the Nationals had the bas
 es loaded and one out\, but Brian Schneider flew out to shallow left fie
 ld and Armas hit a soft liner to first baseman Chad Tracey.\n\nIn the ei
 ghth\, the bases were full of Nationals with two outs\, but Brandon Lyon
  struck out Jamey Carroll.\n\n\"We had a lot of opportunities to put the
  Diamondbacks away. We would have had a nice comfortable game. We just c
 ouldn't just get the big hit\,\" Robinson said. \"You sometimes have to 
 give the pitchers credit. It's not always the hitters' fault that they d
 on't get hits. We could have put them away and Tony would have had a cus
 hion and the three runs wouldn't have meant a thing.\"\n\nDiamondbacks l
 eft-hander Shawn Estes\, a pitcher the Nationals coveted during the offs
 eason\, was the winning pitcher. He pitched six innings and gave up two 
 runs on eight hits. He struck out eight and walked none.\n\nThe National
 s scored those two runs in the fifth inning\, when Brad Wilkerson drove 
 in Schneider and Baerga with a double.\n\n\"Estes looked very sharp. He 
 had a good fastball and breaking ball\,\" Robinson said.\n\nThis story w

SUMMARY:(L) vs Braves
DESCRIPTION:Loss: 4-5\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- The B
 raves scored three runs in the eighth inning to edge the Nationals\, 5-4
 \, in front of 28\,280 fans at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium on Wednesday ni
 ght.\nThe Nationals had a chance to be only one-half game out of first p
 lace in the National League East\, but their relievers\, who have been o
 utstanding for most of the season\, struggled in the top of the eighth a
 nd blew a 4-2 lead.\n\nGoing into that inning\, manager Frank Robinson k
 new he couldn't use his best relievers. Closer Chad Cordero and setup ma
 n Gary Majewski were unavailable to pitch. Cordero had a sore right arm 
 after pitching four consecutive games\, and the Nationals were being cau
 tious with Majewski\, who pitched four out of the last five games.\n\nIn
 stead\, Robinson had to save setup man Luis Ayala\, who usually pitches 
 the eighth inning\, for the closer's role in the ninth.\n\nRight-hander 
 Hector Carrasco started the eighth inning and retired the first two hitt
 ers he faced\, but then couldn't get another batter out.\n\nAfter giving
  up a double to Ryan Langerhans\, Wilson Betemit took Carrasco's first p
 itch and hit a two-run home run that barely cleared the right-field fenc
 e. The home run tied the game at 4.\n\n\"I tried to throw the slider dow
 n in the dirt and it stayed up. It didn't do anything. It stayed right a
 t the middle of the plate\,\" Carrasco said. \"It was the only bad pitch
  I threw.\"\n\nAfter Julio Franco walked and pinch-runner Pete Orr stole
  second\, Carrasco was taken out of the game in favor of T.J. Tucker. Tu
 cker threw a cutter to Marcus Giles\, who singled to left field to drive
  in Orr for the go-ahead run.\n\n\"The pitch was like middle-away\,\" Tu
 cker said. \"It was one of those nights. It was a hard loss\, but we hav
 e to come out and get the Braves tomorrow. We can't mope over this loss.
  We have to come out and win the ball game tomorrow. We are playing good
  baseball.\"\n\nThe winning pitcher was John Smoltz\, while Carrasco too
 k the loss. Braves right-hander Chris Reitsma picked up his second save 
 of the season.\n\n\"Nobody can do it every night\,\" Robinson said. \"We
  were pretty close. Carrasco was one pitch away from doing an excellent 
 job for us. But it just didn't happen. We didn't get it done tonight.\n\
 n\"I don't think we needed this game to show how good [Cordero and Majew
 ski] have been\, because they have been doing the job. They have been pu
 tting those games in the win column. I didn't need this reminder.\"\n\nR
 ight-hander Tony Armas Jr. started for the Nationals and had his best ou
 ting since beating the Brewers on May 18. He pitched six solid innings a
 nd gave up two runs on six hits. He walked four and struck out two.\n\nI
 t helped that Armas had good command of his slider for the first time th
 is season\, and was able to fix some mechanical issues on the mound.\n\n
 \"I was happy that I got my slider back. I threw some good ones and I ba
 ttled out there. The slider had some bite to it\,\" Armas said.\n\nThe f
 irst run was scored in the top of the second inning\, when Johnny Estrad
 a hit a solo home run to give the Braves a 1-0 lead.\n\nAdam LaRoche dro
 ve in the second run for the Braves in the third inning\, when he single
 d to drive in Giles. By that time\, however\, the Nationals already had 
 the lead against Smoltz.\n\nIn the second inning with one out\, Ryan Chu
 rch doubled past LaRoche at first base to drive in Nick Johnson and tie 
 the score at 1.\n\nBrian Schneider made it a 2-1 game by driving in Chur
 ch with a double to right field. After advancing on a Cristian Guzman gr
 ounder\, Schneider came home on a wild pitch. Guzman then made it a 4-2 
 game in the sixth inning by hitting a blooper to center to knock in Chur
 ch.\n\nSmoltz ended up pitching seven innings\, while giving up the four
  runs on six hits.\n\n\"Smoltz stayed in there and kept the Braves in th
 e game as long as he could\,\" Church said. \"He kept us at bay after we
  had a couple of runs. They were still in striking distance. All it took
  was one swing of the bat\, and Betemit came through.\"\n\nThe Nationals
  are now 27-26 -- 2 1/2 games behind the first-place Braves.\n\n\"Agains
 t a division foe\, you are fighting to get into first place\,\" Brad Wil
 kerson said. \"To lose a game like we did is very disappointing. We have
  to come back and regroup tomorrow.\"\n\nThis story was not subject to t

 IM -- On Wednesday night\, there wasn't a near-brawl or gamesmanship bet
 ween the Nationals and Angels. It was just a good old-fashioned pitching

 Colon's first pitch and hit the ball over the right center field wall. I
 t was Schneider's fourth home run.\n\nThe Nationals\, who took two out o

DESCRIPTION:Loss: 0-1\n\nBy Andy Jasner / MLB.com\n\nPHILADELPHIA -- Und
 er different circumstances\, John Patterson might have eight or nine win
 s under his belt by now.\nBut on Saturday\, like many of his previous st
 arts for the Nationals\, Patterson pitched beautifully\, only to wind up
  with a no-decision.\n\nPatterson threw seven stellar shutout innings\, 
 giving up just two hits and striking out eight. However\, the Nationals 
 struggled offensively and fell\, 1-0\, to the Phillies before 33\,365 at
  Citizens Bank Park.\n\n\"I could go out there and win the next eight or
  10 in a row\,\" said Patterson\, who heads into the All-Star break with
  a 3-2 record and 2.91 ERA. \"About 10 no-decisions\, that's about what 
 I have. If I go out and keep throwing the ball the way I've been throwin
 g\, anything can happen.\"\n\nPatterson threw 108 pitches\, 68 for strik
 es\, and kept the Phillies completely befuddled at the plate.\n\n\"Actua
 lly\, I had no slider today\,\" Patterson said. \"I mixed up some change
 ups and kept them off-balance with my curveball. I had a good curveball 
 today. It's a good thing I had a good curve\, because locating my fastba
 ll wouldn't be enough in this ballpark.\"\n\nDespite Patterson's effort\
 , the Nationals had their five-game road winning streak snapped\, as Hec
 tor Carrasco gave up a bases-loaded sacrifice fly to David Bell\, allowi
 ng Bobby Abreu to score with the winning run in the bottom of the ninth.
 \n\"Nothing you can do about it\,\" Carrasco said. \"It was just one of 
 those games.\"\n\nIt was one of those games that the Nationals have been
  winning all season. Their 24 one-run victories are the most in the Majo
 r Leagues.\n\n\"That's the way we've played all year\,\" Nationals manag
 er Frank Robinson said. \"We couldn't get anything going.\"\n\nIt looked
  as if the Nationals would have a chance to score first in the eighth. A
 fter Gary Bennett walked\, Patterson came to the plate to bunt Bennett t
 o second. But Patterson struck out\, and Brad Wilkerson and Jamey Carrol
 l flied out and grounded out\, respectively\, to end the inning.\n\n\"I 
 had gotten every bunt down this year\,\" Patterson said. \"I don't know 
 how many. That's the first time I didn't get a bunt down this year.\"\n\
 nThe Nationals managed just five hits -- all singles -- off Phillies sta
 rter Cory Lidle through eight innings. Only one Nationals baserunner was
  able to advance to second\, that coming when Vinny Castilla singled in 
 the second inning and moved to second base on a wild pitch.\n\nLidle beg
 an the game with a 5-0 lifetime record and 3.19 ERA against the National
 s franchise.\n\nAfter the game\, Robinson was baffled how his team could
  only muster six hits against Lidle and Billy Wagner.\n\n\"Anybody walks
  out there\, you should be able to hit\,\" Robinson said. \"I haven't se
 en a pitcher yet that walked out there that couldn't be hit. Cy Young ga
 ve up his amount of hits. Lidle isn't even close to Cy Young.\"\n\nDespi
 te the loss\, the Nationals are still 52-35\, two games in front of the 
 second-place Atlanta Braves in the National League East.\n\n\"We have to
  go out tomorrow and get a win to finish the first half in a good way\,\
 " said second baseman Jose Vidro. \"This is only one game.\"\n\nThe Nati
 onals face off against the Phillies in the series finale on Sunday at 1:
 35 p.m. ET\, the final game for both teams before the All-Star break.\n\

 RGH -- A funny thing happened in the middle of the home run derby the Wa
 shington Nationals and Pittsburgh Pirates were staging early Wednesday a
 fternoon at PNC Park.\nA pitchers' duel broke out.\nFive home runs -- ge
 nerally of the very deep variety -- were hit in the first 2 1/2 innings.
  Yet after that\, both starting pitchers took control and yielded only t
 wo combined hits through the sixth and the Nationals manufactured enough
  offense to earn a 5-4 victory.\nThe Nationals tied the game at 4 on a m
 asterful steal of home with runners on first and third with two out in t
 he fifth and Brian Schneider's RBI single capped a two-out rally for the
  winning run in the eighth.\nJose Guillen went 4-for-5 with two home run
 s for Washington\, which won five of nine games on a road trip that foll
 owed a 10-game winning streak.\n\"This was a big game today\,\" second b
 aseman Jamey Carroll said. \"We came from behind to win a game\, take a 
 series and [were] over .500 for the road trip.\"\nBefore John Patterson 
 arrived at the ballpark Wednesday morning\, Washington was not even sure
  his stiff back would allow him to start the game. Yet Patterson worked 
 into the seventh inning\, allowing four runs on seven hits. After the Pi
 rates plated four runs with their first 10 batters to open the game\, Pa
 tterson settled down and retired 13 of the next 14 he faced\, including 
 11 in a row.\n\"After the second inning\, I could have gone two ways\,\"
  Patterson said. \"I could have packed it in or I could battle. I decide
 d to battle\, and fortunately\, I hung in there and was able to give the
  team a chance to win.\n\"I learn something new about myself every time 
 out there. I'm happy with how I came back. If I cash it in early in the 
 game\, I don't know if we win it.\"\nPatterson was chased\, however\, af
 ter loading the bases with one out in the seventh. But Hector Carasco (3
 -1) came on and induced Tike Redman to bounce into a fielder's choice be
 fore striking out Jason Bay.\nAfter reliever Mike Gonzalez (0-3) entered
  the game in the eighth and promptly got Nick Johnson to ground into a d
 ouble play\, Schneider blooped his single to shallow left-center followi
 ng walks to Ryan Church and Junior Spivey.\n\n\"I was just lucky I was a
 live\, because he threw me a pitch with two strikes that I just barely g
 ot enough of\,\" Schneider said. \"The pitch I hit was a fastball\, a go
 od pitch. I didn't hit it hard at all\, but I'm happy it found a spot fo
 r us.\"\nWhile that was the difference in the game\, most of the offense
  came early on. The Nationals\, whose 28 come-from-behind wins lead the 
 Major Leagues\, jumped out to a 2-0 lead with some two-out offense in th
 e first. Guillen hit his 14th home run\, a shot to left on a 1-2 pitch. 
 Johnson followed with a single to center and was driven home by Church's
  double.\n\"I'm just doing my thing\, working hard every day\, and if yo
 u do that\, sometimes things happen\,\" Guillen said. \"And good things 
 are happening now.\"\nThe Pirates got those runs back in the bottom of t
 he inning when Bay's 13th home run scored Redman\, who had singled. Rob 
 Mackowiak's two-out home run to deep right gave Pittsburgh a 3-2 advanta
 ge.\nMatt Lawton's shot to deep right-center with two out in the second 
 gave the Pirates a 4-2 advantage. Patterson became stingy after that.\n\
 "That was a real good performance by Patterson\,\" manager Frank Robinso
 n said. \"After the second inning\, he told me\, 'I'm going seven [innin
 gs].' I said\, 'Good. We need it.' It was invaluable that I didn't have 
 to go too deep into the bullpen again.\"\n\n\nGuillen hit his second hom
 er of the game and fourth of the series with two out in the third to mov
 e Washington to within one. The slugger then helped facilitate the Natio
 nals' fourth run\, even though he was not credited with an RBI.\nWith Gu
 illen on first after a single and Carroll on third\, Guillen took off fo
 r second after Pirates starter Josh Fogg faked a throw to third and inte
 ntionally got caught in a rundown long enough to allow Carroll to score 
 and tie the game at 4.\n\"Jose did a great job of staying in the middle 
 and making them make a move\,\" Carroll said. \"As soon as the ball is t
 hrown to a left-handed first baseman [Daryle Ward]\, that's when I break
  for home.\"\nChad Cordero converted his 20th consecutive save opportuni
 ty to give him a Major League-leading 23 on the season. But without help
  from Church\, who bailed out the closer by making a catch before slammi
 ng up against the left-field wall on a ball off the bat of Humberto Cota
 \, the final batter of the game\, things could've turned out differently
 .\nIn the clubhouse after the game\, the pain in Church's shoulder and c
 lavicle area made it painful for him to talk.\n\"It hurts\,\" he said. \
 "But I made the catch [and] we got the 'W\,' so let's get out of here.\n
 \"I'll be sore for a while\, but we got the win\, so it's worth it.\"\nT

 INGTON -- Going for their 13th consecutive victory at home proved to be 
 unlucky for the Nationals\, who lost to the Blue Jays\, 9-5\, in front o
 f 33\,557 at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium on Sunday afternoon.\nThe loss sn
 apped the Nationals' 12-game winning streak at home and dropped their re
 cord to 44-31. The last time the Nationals lost a game at RFK Stadium pr
 ior to Sunday was on June 1 against the Braves.\n\nSunday's game was tie
 d at 5 in the top of the eighth inning\, when the Blue Jays scored two r
 uns off reliever Luis Ayala. After Eric Hinske doubled and Gregg Zaun st
 ruck out\, the switch-hitting Orlando Hudson hit a 1-2 pitch over the ri
 ght-center field wall for a two-run home run. It was Hudson's second hom
 er of the game.\n\n\"I missed a couple of pitches. I tried to throw a si
 nker to Hinske. I thought it was looking good\, but he pulled it and mad
 e it a double\,\" Ayala said. \"I tried to throw the slider a little bit
  away from Hudson\, but it stayed in the middle of the plate.\"\n\nThe B
 lue Jays added to their lead in the ninth inning off right-hander Sunny 
 Kim\, when Vernon Wells singled to left-center field to drive in Alex Ri
 os.\n\nWells would later score in the inning on a sacrifice by Hinske.\n
 \nThe winning pitcher was Justin Speier (1-1)\, while Ayala (6-4) took t
 he loss.\n\nThe Nationals received a scare in the in the bottom of the s
 eventh inning. With runners on first and second and two out\, Vinny Cast
 illa doubled over the head of left fielder Gabe Gross to score Junior Sp
 ivey and Nick Johnson and tie the score at 5.\n\nOn the play\, Johnson b
 ruised his right heel while scoring standing up. He left the game and re
 ceived precautionary X-rays.\n\nJohnson was not available for comment af
 ter the game\, but manager Frank Robinson said that Johnson should have 
 knocked down Zaun at the plate. Zaun was blocking the plate by the time 
 Johnson reached home plate.\n\n\"[Johnson] was trying to avoid Zaun's le
 g. This is why catchers get knocked on their butts\,\" Robinson said. \"
 He blocked the plate\, when he didn't have a play at the plate. As a run
 ner\, you shoulder never avoid knocking them on their butts because ther
 e is a good possibility you will get hurt.\"\n\nRight-hander Tony Armas 
 Jr. started for the Nationals\, and had a no-hitter and a 2-1 lead after
  four innings. But he unraveled in the fifth inning. On an 0-2 fastball\
 , Armas gave up a solo home run to Hudson that tied the score at 2.\n\nA
 fter inducing Blue Jays starter Gustavo Chacin to ground out for the sec
 ond out of the inning\, Armas couldn't get the next four hitters out. Th
 e biggest blow came when Armas gave up a two-run double to Shea Hillenbr
 and to make it a 4-2 game.\n\nReliever Hector Carrasco entered the game\
 , and\, after hitting Aaron Hill with a pitch\, Carrasco uncorked a wild
  pitch that allowed Wells to score.\n\nRobinson said that Armas lost con
 centration after giving up the homer to Hudson. But Armas had no answers
  on what went wrong in the fifth inning.\n\n\"I don't know what happened
 \, but the thing I do know is that I let my team down. I have to do a be
 tter job\,\" Armas said. \"It's tough to explain. I felt so good out the
 re. I felt good with all my pitches. It was just one inning. What can I 
 say?\"\n\nThe Nationals are still in first place in the National League 
 East\, three games ahead of the Braves. Robinson didn't seem too concern
 ed that the Nationals' 12-game winning streak at RFK Stadium came to an 
 end.\n\n\"I don't pay attention to that. Each time you go out\, you just
  focus on the game you are playing\,\" Robinson said. \"You don't say\, 
 'Wow\, we have a 12-game winning streak at home.' It's nice that we had 
 the streak.\"\n\nThis story was not subject to the approval of Major Lea

SUMMARY:(L) vs Mets
DESCRIPTION:Loss: 2-5\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- Right
 -hander Livan Hernandez had one bad inning on Saturday night\, and it co
 st him\, as the Nationals lost to the Mets\, 5-2\, in front of 32\,467 a
 t Robert F. Kennedy Stadium.\nThe loss means that the tragic number of W
 ild Card elimination is down to one. The Nationals are seven games behin
 d the Astros in the Wild Card race.\n\nIt was shoddy defense and bad pit
 ch selection that put the Nationals behind by five runs in the first inn
 ing.\n\nMets shortstop Jose Reyes started the inning off by hitting a fl
 y ball to left fielder Brandon Watson\, who lost the ball in the lights.
  He then dove for the ball\, but it dropped for a double.\n\n\"Usually\,
  I catch it. But it came out of the glove somehow. I did all that I coul
 d do\,\" Watson said.\n\nMiguel Cairo was the next hitter\, and he dropp
 ed a bunt down the third-base line. Hernandez grabbed the ball and threw
  a perfect strike to first baseman Tony Blanco\, who dropped the ball fo
 r an error to put runners on first and third with no outs.\n\nBlanco sai
 d he didn't catch the ball because Cairo blocked his view.\n\n\"You have
  to catch that ball [at] this level\,\" Blanco said.\n\nBlanco ended up 
 making two errors in the game. In the sixth inning\, he dropped an easy 
 throw from Cristian Guzman.\n\nHernandez was diplomatic when talking Bla
 nco's error in the first inning.\n\n\"Nobody is perfect\,\" Hernandez sa
 id. \"I continued to pitch and tried to get out of the inning.\"\n\nBut 
 Hernandez had tough time retiring batters. Carlos Beltran followed Cairo
  and collected an infield single to score Jose Reyes to give the Mets th
 e 1-0 lead.\n\nAfter Cliff Floyd walked to load the bases\, David Wright
  took a 2-0 fastball and hit a grand slam over the left-field facade to 
 give the Mets a 5-0 lead.\n\nManager Frank Robinson felt that Hernandez 
 should have thrown a different pitch to Wright in that inning.\n\n\"We c
 ontinue to get behind hitters in those situations and throw fastballs. W
 e don't seem to be able to figure out to throw something else other than
  fastballs when we are behind hitters\,\" Robinson said.\n\nHernandez sa
 id that he needed to throw the ball near the middle of the plate.\n\n\"I
  didn't want to walk Wright with the bases loaded. He hit the ball good\
 , and he hit out\,\" Hernandez said.\n\nHernandez ended up pitching eigh
 t innings and giving up five runs -- four earned. He struck out six batt
 ers and walked one.\n\n\"He did a very good job after the first inning\,
 \" Robinson said. \"I don't think he had a lot with those five runs toni
 ght. It should have been a much easier inning and a much different situa
 tion\, if we make the defensive plays.\"\n\nMets left-hander Tom Glavine
  picked up his 12th victory of the season by pitching eight innings and 
 giving up two runs on four hits.\n\nBoth runs were scored in the in the 
 bottom of the seventh inning. Watson drove in Hernandez with in an infie
 ld single\, and Watson scored the second run of the game on a double by 
 Ryan Zimmerman.\n\nZimmerman ended up with his second straight multihit 
 game\, going 3-for-4. Two of those hits came off Glavine. Zimmerman is n
 ow 14-for-29 (.483) with four RBIs.\n\n\"Glavine is a person that I watc
 hed growing up\, and I played video that featured him. Playing against g
 uys like that and being in the same sentence is fun. It's exciting\, and
  I'm having fun with it.\n\nThis story was not subject to the approval o

SUMMARY:(W) vs Pirates
DESCRIPTION:Win: 2-1\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- A few 
 minutes after the Nationals edged the Pirates\, 2-1\, on Tuesday night a
 t RFK Stadium\, manager Frank Robinson was walking toward the Nationals'
  dugout and flashing \"No. 1\" with his index finger.\nWas he finally ad
 mitting that the Nationals are legitimate playoff contenders? The answer
  is no. He wanted to show the fans how much he appreciated their support
 .\n\n\"What I was doing was giving the fans recognition and letting them
  know what they mean to this ballclub\,\" said Robinson. \"They are grea
 t fans. No. 1. I'm just saying\, 'Thank you for coming out here and supp
 orting this ballclub.' \"\n\nThe 35\,828 who attended the game were not 
 disappointed\, as they saw right-hander Ryan Drese pitch eight solid inn
 ings\, giving up one run on five hits. He struck out four batters and wa
 lked none. Drese's bread-and-butter pitch was the sinker\, as he induced
  15 ground-ball outs.\n\nThe one run was scored in the top of the first 
 inning\, when Daryle Ward drove in Jason Bay with a single to give the P
 irates a 1-0 lead.\n\nRobinson said that Drese's performance was similar
  to his first outing in a Nationals uniform\, on June 15\, when he pitch
 ed eight shutout innings against the Angels.\n\n\"That was one of the fi
 ner performances that we've had this year\,\" said Robinson. \"He kept m
 aking the pitches. He wasn't in complete control as he was against the [
 Angels]\, but he made some pitches when he had to. He helped his teammat
 es out.\"\n\nThe Nationals came back with two runs in the bottom of the 
 fourth inning without getting a hit off right-hander Josh Fogg (4-4).\n\
 nWith runners on first and second\, and no outs\, Marlon Byrd popped up 
 a bunt\, but the ball dropped between Fogg and catcher Ryan Doumit. Fogg
  grabbed the ball and tried to throw out Jose Guillen at third base\, bu
 t he threw the ball away\, allowing Guillen to score the tying run.\n\nW
 ith runners on first and third and no outs\, Wil Cordero hit a sacrifice
  fly to right field to score Vinny Castilla and give the Nationals the 2
 -1 lead. It was Cordero's first RBI of the season.\n\n\"Wil knew what th
 e situation called for\,\" said Robinson. \"The one thing about Wil is t
 hat he doesn't panic at the plate. He had a plan in that situation\, and
  that was to hit a fly ball. That's what he's capable of doing. He is a 
 tough out when he is in good shape.\"\n\nCordero has been under scrutiny
  after going 1-for-26 before Tuesday's tilt. A club source said before t
 he game that Cordero is not on solid footing\, as he was to start the se
 ason or when he was activated from the disabled list on May 30.\n\n\"I h
 ave no excuses. I just have to get hits\,\" said Cordero. \"When you are
  in this level\, you have to get it done. ... But I'm not going to go do
 wn easy.\"\n\nIt looked as if the Pirates were going to tie the score in
  the seventh inning. They had runners on first and third and no outs\, b
 ut Drese managed to get out of the jam. Jose Castillo hit a ground ball 
 to shortstop Cristian Guzman\, who threw out Rob Mackowiak at the plate 
 for the first out. Drese then struck out Jack Wilson and induced pinch-h
 itter Tike Redman to ground out to Cordero at first base to end the inni
 ng.\n\n\"It shows me that Drese doesn't panic. He goes out there and doe
 s what he has to do. He's a cool customer out there. He doesn't get rile
 d up. He did the job tonight\,\" said Robinson. \"If we get the consiste
 ncy out of him\, then we are on our way.\"\n\nDrese's performance was th
 e antithesis of his last outing against the Pirates\, on June 21\, when 
 he gave up five runs in three innings. Drese said that he was successful
  on Tuesday because he threw better breaking balls.\n\n\"We didn't chang
 e the game plan. I was trying to stay on top of the ball and keep it dow
 n\,\" said Drese. \"I threw a few more quality breaking balls this time.
  The last time I was up on a few breaking balls. We needed to win tonigh
 t. It's always good to get the first one against any team in a series. O
 ne mistake was the difference.\"\n\nChad Cordero pitched the ninth innin
 g and recorded his 26th save of the season. He now has converted 23 cons
 ecutive save opportunities\, which ties a franchise record set by Mel Ro
 jas in 1996\, when he was a member of the Expos.\n\n\"That's pretty cool
  to do something like that. It's a big accomplishment. I hope I can keep
  it going. I hope we keep getting these wins\,\" said Cordero.\n\nThis s

 ing from the leadoff position.\n\nIt's the second time in Wilkerson's ca
 reer that has hit for the cycle\, a feat also accomplished June 24\, 200
 3\, against the Pirates at Olympic Stadium.\n\nWilkerson said that Wedne
 sday's cycle was much sweeter because it helped the Nationals pick up th
 eir first victory in franchise history.\n\n\"It's a special day to get t
 he first-ever victory in franchise history\,\" Wilkerson said. \"We came
  up with some big hits tonight. Everybody contributed. We pitched well a
 nd played good defense.\"\n\nThe last player in the organization to hit 
 for the cycle was Vladimir Guerrero on Sept. 14\, 2003\, against the Met
 s.\n\nWilkerson also became the first player from a Washington team to h
 it for the cycle since Senators outfielder Jim King pulled the trick aga
 inst the Red Sox on May 26\, 1964.\n\nOn Wednesday\, Wilkerson went 4-fo
 r-4 with two RBIs. In the third inning\, he homered off starter Brett My
 ers to give the Nationals a 1-0 lead. In the fifth inning\, he singled t
 o right off Myers.\n\n\"He just had a great game\,\" Myers said. \"We al
 l tried to keep him off-balance\, but he just hit everything. He had a g
 reat game.\"\n\nTwo innings later\, Wilkerson tripled off Rheal Cormier.
  As he was rounding second base\, Wilkerson hurt his left ankle. He said

 he ball found Vinny Castilla in the late innings Friday\, it was a good 
 sign for the Washington Nationals.\nCastilla made four key plays with ru

 n\nWashington took the series opener against the Rockies 4-2 in front of
  28\,598 at Coors Field\, to remain three games back in the National Lea
 gue Wild Card race\, as Houston also won.\n\n\"This time of the season\,
  every game is important\,\" Castilla said. \"We know we're still in a r
 ace\; we know we're running out of time.\"\n\nThe first two Rockies hitt
 ers singled in the seventh\, with Washington clinging to a three-run lea
 d. On a sacrifice bunt attempt\, Castilla charged and barehanded the bal
 l\, beating out speedy Cory Sullivan.\n\n\"The biggest things you learn 
 from a guy like that come from watching him play\,\" said Rockies third 
 baseman Garrett Atkins\, who watched Castilla play third for Colorado la
 st season. \"He makes it look easy. If I could look like that some day\,
  I'd be doing all right.\"\n\nAfter starter Esteban Loaiza issued a walk
  to load the bases\, Luis Ayala came in and induced two infield popups -
 - both of which landed in Castilla's glove.\n\nIn the eighth\, with one 
 out and a runner on\, Joey Eischen came in to relieve Ayala and threw on

SUMMARY:(L) vs Mets
DESCRIPTION:Loss: 2-5\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- In th
 e last week or so\, Nationals manager Frank Robinson has noticed a trend
 . Late in the game\, his pitchers have been walking hitters to start a r
 ally and then\, a couple of batters later\, someone on the opposing team
  hits a game-winning home run.\nThat was case on Friday night as the Met
 s defeated the Nationals\, 5-2\, in 10 innings in front of 30\,194 at Ro
 bert F. Kennedy Stadium.\n\nThe loss meant that the Nationals are elimin
 ated from the National League East race\, and they are three games away 
 from being eliminated from the Wild Card Race.\n\nReliever Gary Majewski
  was on the mound when the Mets scored three runs in the top of the 10th
  inning.\n\nWith one out\, Majewski walked Marlon Anderson. Jose Reyes f
 ollowed and hit a groundball right at shortstop Deivi Cruz\, but the bal
 l went by Cruz for an error to put runners on first and third. After Vic
 tor Diaz struck out\, Carlos Beltran came to the plate.\n\nOn a full cou
 nt\, Beltran hit the ball over the right-field fence to give the Mets th
 e three-run lead. It was only the second home run Majewski has given up 
 all year.\n\n\"When you get behind the hitter\, what do [the pitchers] c
 ome up with? Fastballs\,\" Robinson said. \"He went 3-2 on Beltran. You 
 are going to try to get more of the plate. We are setting up ourselves f
 or failure by walking the wrong people and getting behind hitters who ca
 n hit the ball out of the ballpark. We give them a nice fastball to hit 
 when the pitcher gets behind. ... You have to be able to do something el
 se when you have a fastball count at this level.\"\n\nMajewski said he w
 as trying to keep the ball inside on Beltran\, but threw the fastball ov
 er the middle of the plate.\n\n\"I didn't quite get him exactly where I 
 wanted it. I wanted him in off the plate\,\" Majewski said. \"If I walke
 d him\, I walked him. He's one of those guys you don't want to beat you.
  I made a mistake and he hit it.\"\n\nRoberto Hernandez earned the win a
 nd Aaron Heilman picked up his second save of the season for the Mets\, 
 while Majewski picked up the loss.\n\nNationals starter Esteban Loaiza p
 itched seven solid innings and gave up two runs on seven hits. He struck
  out seven batters and walked none. But Loaiza ended up with his 12th no
 -decision of the season.\n\n\"I have one more start and I want to finish
  strong\,\" Loaiza said. \"I have been frustrated\, but this is baseball
 . I have been doing my job and I have been throwing strikes\, trying to 
 get people out.\"\n\nLoaiza could be making his last start in a National
 s uniform on Tuesday against the Marlins. Loaiza and the Nationals have 
 a mutual option for $2.9 million. There is a possibility Loaiza might wa
 nt to test the free-agent market instead of accepting the option.\n\n\"I

  haven't seen that in a while\,\" Robinson said.\n\nFor Baerga\, he was 
 in a 2-for-23 slump before hitting the homer with two outs.\n\n\"I neede

 an Church's three-run double in the top of the ninth inning helped the N
 ationals defeat the Giants\, 11-8\, in front of 40\,220 fans at SBC Park
  on Saturday afternoon.\nThe Nationals were down\, 8-7\, when they score
  four runs in the ninth. With Jeffery Hammonds on third\, Brad Wilkerson
  hit his second sacrifice fly of the game off Jeremy Accardo to tie the 
 score at 8.\n\nThe Nationals then had the bases loaded when Church hit t
 he three-run double off Jim Brower.\n\nIt was the second comeback of the
  game for the Nationals. The first came in the fourth. They came back fr
 om a 4-0 deficit and scored seven runs in the fourth inning.\n\nThe seve
 n runs would have never scored without manager Frank Robinson taking out
  starter John Patterson in the inning. With the bases loaded and none ou
 t\, Robinson decided to take Paterson out of the game for pinch-hitter J
 ose Guillen\, who singled in two runs off Jason Schmidt and made it a 4-
 2 game.\n\nBrad Wilkerson then made it a 4-3 game by hitting a sacrifice
  fly to score Endy Chavez. After Jamey Carroll walked\, Nick Johnson gav
 e the Nationals a 5-4 lead by hitting a two-run double.\n\nChurch and Br

DESCRIPTION:Loss: 3-6\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nHOUSTON -- The Nati
 onals are sinking fast in the pennant race\, and Thursday's game proved 
 to be one of their worst of the season as they were pounded by the Astro
 s\, 6-3\, in front of 35\,036 at Minute Maid Park.\nThe Nationals have n
 ow lost five out of their last six games. Going into the three-game seri
 es\, the Nationals had a chance tie the Astros for the Wild Card lead. N
 ow\, they find themselves three games behind the Houston and 6 1/2 games
  behind the Braves in the National League East.\n\nAfter the game\, mana
 ger Frank Robinson was asked if he was optimistic that the Nationals cou
 ld get themselves back in the race. He is hopeful that the pitching\, wh
 ich has been stellar all season\, would give them an opportunity to stay
  in the race. But he didn't have much hope for the offense\, which is th
 e worst in the Major Leagues.\n\n\"[The pitching] is the only hope I see
 . I don't see any hope offensively\,\" Robinson said.\n\nRobinson then a
 sked the media if they saw any hope\, and one member suggested that they
  bring up their Minor Leaguers such as third baseman Ryan Zimmerman\, bu
 t Robinson said it's not that easy.\n\n\"You make those moves and somebo
 dy has to come off the 40-man roster and the payroll goes up. If it was 
 that simple\, we would have had the truck backed up\,\" Robinson said. \
 "Maybe [the Minor Leaguers] would not swing at the ball on the ground --
  strike three. Maybe they would make better contact. You never know.\"\n
 \nAstros left-hander Andy Pettitte showed how bad the Nationals' offense
  was on Thursday. He pitched eight solid innings and gave up two runs on
  four hits. He struck out five batters and walked two.\n\n\"I think he w
 as working in and out with his cutter. He was getting ahead of us. We ha
 d to work to get on base\,\" shortstop Jamey Carroll said. \"We couldn't
  get anything going. We couldn't put the barrel on the ball.\"\n\nThe Na
 tionals scored two runs off Pettitte in the top of the seventh inning\, 
 when Preston Wilson hit a two-run home run. By that time\, however\, the
  Astros had a comfortable lead.\n\nThe Nationals scored their final run 
 of the game in the ninth inning\, when Jose Guillen hit a home run off r
 eliever Dan Wheeler.\n\n\"I think we are overusing that term\, 'offense.
 ' I think there has to be something else to describe our lack of offense
 . You can't classify it as offense anymore\,\" Robinson said. \"We don't
  seem to be able to get somebody to get that big hit and get something g
 oing.\"\n\nRyan Drese started for the Nationals\, and he was antithesis 
 of Pettitte\, giving up six runs-- five earned -- in 5 1/3 innings.\n\nT
 he Astros took a 1-0 lead in the first inning as Lance Berkman doubled t
 o right-center field to score Craig Biggio.\n\nIn the third inning\, the
  Astros made it a three-run game when Berkman singled home Willie Tavare
 s and Jason Lane brought home Biggio with another single.\n\n\"I felt go
 od [after three innings]. I just stuck with it. [Catcher Gary Bennett] c
 ame out and told me to throw ground balls and good things would happen\,
 \" Drese said.\n\nBut it would get worse in the fifth inning. An error b
 y third baseman Vinny Castilla proved costly and it allowed the Astros t
 o score three more runs.\n\nThe Astros had a runner on second and one ou
 t when Eric Bruntlett hit the ball back to Drese\, who noticed that Morg
 an Ensberg was between second and third base. Drese ran close to Ensberg
  and threw to second baseman Jose Vidro\, who then threw a perfect throw
  to Castilla\, but Castilla dropped the ball and Ensberg was safe at thi
 rd\, while Bruntlett advanced to second on the play.\n\nBesides Castilla
 's miscue\, Robinson thought that Drese should have ran Ensberg back to 
 second base instead of quickly throwing to Vidro once Drese got close to
  Ensberg.\n\n\"Number 1\, the pitcher didn't run it correctly. Number 2\
 , Vinny has got to catch that ball. Catch the ball and we get him out\,\
 " Robinson said. \"We wound up getting nothing.\"\n\nDrese said he would
 n't do anything differently.\n\n\"I did it exactly how I was supposed to
  do it. It was a big play\, but it's baseball\,\" Drese said.\n\nNot get
 ting that second out proved to be costly. After Chris Burke walked to lo
 ad the bases\, Brad Ausmus cleared them with a double down the right-fie
 ld line to give the Astros a 6-0 lead.\n\nRobinson expressed concern abo
 ut Drese\, who is 0-5 with a 6.93 ERA in his last five starts.\n\n\"He c
 an't consistently throw the ball the way he wants to throw it\,\" Robins
 on said. \"I'm looking for a sinkerball pitcher to get me a ground ball 
 to get us out of the inning\, and he throws the ball up. You can't get a
  ground ball when the ball is up there. You don't know what you are goin
 g to get from one pitch to the next.\"\n\n\nThis story was not subject t

DESCRIPTION:Win: 5-1\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nSAN DIEGO -- Prior t
 o Friday's action\, the last time John Patterson pitched at PETCO Park w
 as on April 27 of last season\, and he tore his right groin in the fifth
  inning of that game against the Padres. Patterson would miss almost thr
 ee months because of the injury.\nFast forward to Friday. Patterson retu
 rned to PETCO Park\, only this time he was healthy\, pitched his second 
 complete game of the season and helped the Nationals defeat the Padres\,
  5-1\, in front of 38\,480 fans.\n\nThe Nationals have won four consecut
 ive games and remain 2 1/2 games behind the Astros in the National Leagu
 e Wild Card race. Houston edged the Brewers\, 2-1\, at Minute Maid Park 
 on Friday.\n\n\"I really want to make this push to make the playoffs. Al
 l I was thinking about was getting a win and pushing this team closer to
  playoffs\,\" Patterson said.\n\nPatterson admitted he thought about his
  groin injury before the game. When he was warming up\, in fact\, he sli
 pped on the mound\, and that's when the flashbacks came to him.\n\n\"I c
 aught my back spike a little bit\, just tossing the ball in there\, and 
 I said\, 'Oh\, my gosh.'\" Patterson said. \"But I didn't think about it
  during the game at all. I was thinking about throwing strikes.\"\n\nPat
 terson\, known as the \"Big Nasty\,\" gave up the one run on three hits.
  He struck outs six and walked none. The only mistake Patterson made was
  in the first inning\, when he gave up a solo home run to Ramon Hernande
 z\, who gave the Padres a 1-0 lead.\n\n\"I was a little rusty early in t
 he game\, but [catcher Gary Bennett] and I were working well together\,\
 " he said. \"I focused on my location. I got it down in the zone\, mixin
 g my pitches. Once we scored the runs\, it got me in a groove. After tha
 t\, I felt great.\"\n\nIt was Patterson's first outing since Sept. 8. He
  had missed a start because a sinus infection and bronchitis that turned
  into a slight asthma attack. Patterson said he didn't feel great\, but 
 he was happy to save the bullpen\, which has been overworked of late. In
  fact\, the team will have a starter-by-committee\, beginning with Hecto
 r Carrasco on Saturday night.\n\n\"These guys need a rest. It's late in 
 the year. Quite a few of them have 70 appearances. They have been big fo
 r us all year. Coming back tomorrow with a little more fuel would be goo
 d\,\" Patterson said.\n\nJake Peavy was Patterson's counterpart\, and he
  was not the same pitcher who shut out the Nationals on Aug. 7. This tim
 e\, he pitched six inning and gave up four runs -- three earned -- on se
 ven hits. It was Peavy's first start since Sept. 4. He had been battling
  shoulder problems before Friday's outing.\n\n\"Peavy wasn't at the top 
 of his game tonight. He is just coming back from a shoulder problem. Tha
 t wasn't [really] Peavy out there tonight\, but we'll take it\,\" manage
 r Frank Robinson said.\n\nThe Nationals ended up giving Patterson the le
 ad in the fifth inning off Peavy. With two outs\, Cristian Guzman double
 d home Vinny Castilla and Gary Bennett to give Washington a 2-1 lead. En
 tering the game\, Guzman was hitting .106 (5-for-47) with runners in sco
 ring position and two outs.\n\nIn the sixth inning\, with the bases load
 ed\, Preston Wilson hit a chopper to third baseman Sean Burroughs\, who 
 threw the ball away\, allowing two more runs to score. Wilson was credit
 ed with a base hit and an RBI on the play because he would have clearly 
 beaten the throw to first.\n\nIn the ninth\, with reliever Clay Hensley 
 on the mound\, Guzman tripled home Bennett to give the Nationals the fou
 r-run lead.\n\n\"He is doing the things that he did in Spring Training a
 nd during batting practice. Now he's taking it into the game\,\" Robinso
 n said of Guzman. \"Has he gotten it completely down? No\, but he has go
 tten it down to the point where he could be a tough out.\"\n\nGuzman end
 ed up going 2-for-4 in the game and driving in a season-high three runs.
  All of a sudden\, Guzman is shutting up his critics\, who have felt for
  weeks he should have been benched because of his lack of hitting. Durin
 g the month of September\, however\, Guzman is hitting .324\, raising hi
 s average from 195 to .207.\n\nWhat is Guzman doing right these days? He
 's waiting to hit only the fastball\, which is something hitting coach T
 om McCraw has been preaching to him for months.\n\n\"He is a different g
 uy when he is hitting fastballs\,\" McGraw said. \"The last four or five
  games he has hit a lot of fastballs. He has done one hell of a job for 
 us. He has stopped going after the breaking ball and [he's] getting that
  fastball strike.\"\n\nThis story was not subject to the approval of Maj

  Hernandez pitched his second complete game of the season\, but the Nati
 onals lost to the Giants\, 4-3\, in front of 32\,403 at RFK Stadium on T
 uesday night.\nThe Nationals extended their losing streak to three games
 \, and with 11 games to play\, are five games behind the Astros in the N
 ational League Wild Card race.\n\nThe Nationals had a 2-1 lead with two 
 outs and a runner on first base in the ninth inning and Barry Bonds comi
 ng to the plate. It was a case of picking your poison -- facing Bonds or
  Moises Alou.\n\nManager Frank Robinson came to the mound to inform Hern
 andez that he shouldn't give Bonds anything to pull. In the fourth innin
 g\, Bonds had taken an inside fastball and hit a mammoth home run into t
 he right-field bleachers.\n\n\"Livan has\, like\, five different fastbal
 ls\,\" said Bonds. \"He'll throw one a little bit harder than the other.
  He'll mix his pitches up pretty good. He has great pinpoint accuracy. \
 "\n\nHernandez ended up walking Bonds on four pitches\, although the hur
 ler thought two of those balls were strikes.\n\n\"I threw a couple of ba
 lls right there\, but the umpires didn't call it\,\" said Hernandez. \"I
  didn't want to walk Barry\, but I didn't want to pitch inside\, because
  I didn't want him to pull [anything] to right field.\"\n\nAlou followed
  and hit a first-pitch slider over the left-field wall for his 18th home
  run of the season\, giving the Giants a 4-2 lead.\n\n\"You are going to
  give up hits here and there\, but we are not keeping the ball in the ba
 llpark\,\" said Robinson. \"We are losing games on one swing of the bat.
  We are also setting that up with walks.\"\n\nHernandez gave up four run
 s on four hits\, struck out seven and walked three.\n\n\"He had a very g
 ood performance before the ninth inning\,\" said Robinson. \"It was typi
 cal Livan. It was a very well-pitched game. He moved his ball around the
  strike zone and kept the hitters off balance. It was one of his better 
 games.\"\n\nRight-hander Matt Cain\, Hernandez's counterpart\, was just 
 as effective\, pitching seven innings and giving up two runs on four hit
 s. He struck out seven batters and walked two.\n\nThe Nationals took a 2
 -1 lead off Cain in the fifth inning. With the score tied at 1\, Brad Wi
 lkerson singled to center field to score Brian Schneider.\n\nWilkerson h
 ad scored the first run of the game in the first inning on a sacrifice f
 ly by Jose Guillen.\n\nThe Nationals made it interesting against San Fra
 ncisco closer Armando Benitez in the ninth inning. They had the bases lo
 aded and one out when pinch-hitter Ryan Zimmerman hit a sacrifice fly to
  left field\, driving in Brandon Watson and making it a one-run game.\n\
 nThe next hitter\, Wilkerson\, clubbed the ball to left field. It looked
  as though ball was going to drop for at least a double\, because outfie
 lder Todd Linden -- a defensive replacement for Bonds -- misjudged the b
 all. But Linden managed to make a diving catch near the warning track to
  end the game.\n\n\"I didn't have a great read on it\,\" said Linden. \"
 I didn't realize it was hit as well as it was. Then I had to deal with t
 he slice. But I knew I was with it the whole way.\"\n\nSaid Wilkerson: \
 "I knew I hit it pretty hard. The ball was turning. When turned he aroun
 d\, I thought\, 'Wow\, we might win this game.' And then he totally got 
 it. It took the wind out of me a little bit.\"\n\nThe winning pitcher wa
 s Jack Taschner\, and Benitez recorded his 17th save of the season. The 
 Nationals have now lost their last three games in the opponent's last at
 -bat.\n\nSchneider is arguably the most positive player after losses\, a
 lways saying that the team will come back the next day. But on Tuesday h
 e admitted that the Nationals' chances of making the playoffs are slim.\
 n\nHe also pointed that the Nationals should be on a seven-game winning 
 streak\, but the last three games have been heartbreakers.\n\n\"It's goi
 ng to take a lot for us to make the playoffs right now\, and everybody h
 ere knows that\,\" said Schneider. \"We put ourselves against the wall. 
 It's easy throughout the season to say\, 'It's OK.' We have so many game
 s left\, but we know what the situation is. We know how close we are of 
 not making the playoffs.\"\n\n\nThis story was not subject to the approv

SUMMARY:(W) vs Cardinals
DESCRIPTION:Win: 4-1\n\nBy Jeff Seidel / Special to MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTO
 N -- Washington manager Frank Robinson can be a tough man to please\, bu
 t even the Hall of Famer enjoyed most parts of the Nationals' 4-1 win ov
 er the St. Louis Cardinals at RFK Stadium on Friday night.\n\"We did a l
 ot of [good] things\,\" Robinson said. \"This is what we should do. This
  is how we should play a game.\"\n\nSome of those good things include Es
 teban Loaiza setting the tone by throwing seven-plus strong innings and 
 then helping his own cause with an RBI single\; Brad Wilkerson homering 
 to lead off the first and walking three times to help the Nationals repe
 atedly get runners on base\; and\, Jose Guillen reaching on an infield s
 ingled on a pure hustle play in the fourth.\n\nIn addition\, Joey Eische
 n\, Gary Majewski and Chad Cordero combined to close out the final two i
 nnings and lock up the victory. Cordero threw a perfect ninth for his 41
 st save -- two away from tying the franchise record.\n\nHowever\, everyt
 hing started with Loaiza's strong effort. He turned in one of his best p
 erformances of the season\, allowing just one run and three hits. The ri
 ght-hander threw 96 pitches -- 60 for strikes -- and shut down the St. L
 ouis offense. He struck out seven\, walked four and retired 11 straight 
 at one point.\n\n\"I just wanted to throw my pitches for strikes\,\" Loa
 iza said. \"I want to be out there as long as I can. I could've gone lon
 ger\, [but] the relievers did the job.\"\n\nLoaiza (9-9) stayed in comma
 nd throughout his outing\, and Robinson pulled him after the hurler walk
 ed pinch-hitter John Rodriguez to start the eighth inning.\n\n\"Loaiza d
 id a heck of a job\, a tremendous job\,\" Robinson said. \"He got into a
  real good groove. He moved the ball up and down\, in and out\, in the s
 trike zone -- and we needed it.\"\n\nThe Nationals also benefitted from 
 a couple unusual plays early in the game. The Cardinals put runners on f
 irst and third with one out in the first inning. That's when Jim Edmonds
  hit a hard grounder to first baseman Nick Johnson. Instead of coming ho
 me\, Johnson quickly stepped on first and then tagged Larry Walker\, who
  was diving back to the base.\n\nThat rare double play stopped St. Louis
  from scoring quickly\, got Loaiza out of some early trouble and gave hi
 m a quick boost.\n\n\"It was a big inning and it was [two] big outs\,\" 
 Loaiza said. \"Nick Johnson did a great job.\"\n\nWilkerson then added t
 o Washington's early momentum by blasting his 10th home run off St. Loui
 s starter Jeff Suppan (12-10) to start the bottom of the first. It was h
 is third leadoff homer of the season and the 15th of his career. He's al
 so homered in back-to-back games for the first time this season.\n\nWhil
 e Loaiza kept the Cardinals' offense quiet\, the Nationals kept stirring
  up trouble. Washington then broke the game open with two runs in the fo
 urth inning and then another in the fifth -- also thanks to some unusual
  plays.\n\nGuillen started the fourth inning by hitting a slow roller do
 wn the first-base line that started in foul territory. But Suppan let it
  go and the ball suddenly took a sharp left turn and veered fair\, leavi
 ng first baseman Albert Pujols with no chance to do anything.\n\n\"It ju
 st worked out the right way for us\,\" Guillen said. \"It worked out rea
 l well for us.\"\n\nPreston Wilson then followed with a single to right 
 and Brian Schneider hit a shot that Pujols could only knock down. That l
 et Guillen score to make it 2-0. Loaiza came up later in the inning with
  runners on first and third and two out and lined an RBI single to cente
 r.\n\n\"I just wanted to make contact and I did\,\" Loaiza said of his f
 ourth RBI of the season.\n\nThe Nationals made it 4-0 with another run i
 n the fifth. Guillen helped again by lining a triple to right and scorin
 g on a Wilson sacrifice fly.\n\nLoaiza finally ran into trouble in the s
 eventh\, walking Edmonds\, who later scored on a So Taguchi single. Robi
 nson finally pulled Loaiza after he walked Rodriguez to start the eighth

SUMMARY:(L) vs Cardinals
DESCRIPTION:Loss: 0-6\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- Here'
 s a message to opposing pitchers who are not having good seasons: If you
  want to get out of your slump\, pitch against the struggling Nationals 
 offense\, and you will be back to your old self.\nAsk the Cardinals' Jas
 on Marquis. Entering Saturday's game\, he was 0-7 with a 7.24 ERA in his
  last seven starts\, but one would have never known he was in a funk as 
 he pitched a complete-game shutout over the Nationals\, 6-0\, at RFK Sta
 dium.\n\nMarquis gave up two hits\, struck out three and walked none.\n\
 n\"Once we [got] the lead\, I was able to pound the zone\, in the strike
  zone and down\, and if one did get up\, I got away with it\,\" said Mar
 quis.\n\nNationals third baseman Vinny Castilla\, who played with Marqui
 s in Atlanta\, was surprised by Marquis' performance\, saying that his e
 x-teammate used to throw a lot of four-seam fastballs that were high. On
  Saturday\, Marquis threw a lot of two-seam fastballs that were low\, an
 d Castilla didn't see them coming.\n\n\"He threw the two-seam fastball a
 t any count\,\" said Castilla. \"He had good control of it\, and he kept
  jamming us all day long. Sometimes you have to tip your hat to a perfor
 mance like Marquis'. He used his slider\, changeup and two-seam fastball
  a lot.\"\n\nMarquis is not the first struggling pitcher to have his way
  with the Nationals. As recently as Aug. 23\, Reds right-hander Luke Hud
 son\, who had a 7.35 ERA entering that game\, pitched seven solid inning
 s and gave up two runs as Cincinnati defeated the Nationals\, 6-2.\n\nBu
 t what has bothered manager Frank Robinson even more is that the Nationa
 ls were flat throughout the game\, just one day after beating the Cardin
 als convincingly. He knew early that his team was in trouble.\n\n\"I don
 't know what it is\,\" said Robinson. \"I can't figure this team out. Th
 e more [opposing] pitchers struggle or the higher the ERA is\, the worse
  we do against them. ... We were swinging at a lot of first pitches out 
 of the strike zone. We don't work the count. We don't do anything to bre
 ak the rhythm of the other pitcher or battle to get on base.\n\n\"What h
 as really baffled me is\, we come out and play with energy [on Friday] a
 nd the next day\, we don't play with the [same] type of intensity and en
 ergy. That's what I don't understand. You can't always get the hits\, an
 d you are not going to make the plays\, but you can play with energy. Yo
 u can give it a real good effort each day.\"\n\nAsked if the team was ti
 red after playing a day game following a night game\, Robinson said\, \"
 It shouldn't be anything this time of the year. After this week and next
  month\, you can rest all you want to. I can't let them off the hook tha
 t easy.\"\n\nLeft-hander Matt White\, called up from Triple-A New Orlean
 s on Saturday to replace the injured Ryan Drese\, was hit hard. He pitch
 ed four innings and gave up four runs on four hits. He struck out three 
 and walked three.\n\nThe Cardinals scored three of those runs in the top
  of the third inning. Albert Pujols drove in Abraham Nunez with a sacrif
 ice fly to right field to give the Cardinals a 1-0 lead. After Yadier Mo
 lina walked to load the bases\, So Taguchi singled to left to drive in t
 wo more runs.\n\nIn the fourth\, David Eckstein singled to center to dri
 ve in Nunez.\n\n\"[White] was decent in a couple of spots\, but you coul
 d see when the Cardinals scored that he was squeezing the ball a little 
 tight\,\" said Robinson. \"When Taguchi singled\, that was supposed to b
 e a curve ball down\, but it was up in his eyes. All in all\, it wasn't 
 a bad outing. It was a short outing. We had hoped that he would have gon
 e five or six innings and kept us in the game.\"\n\nAfter the game\, Whi
 te was sent back to New Orleans\, and reliever Jason Bergman will be pro
 moted on Sunday.\n\nBecause of all the injuries in recent days\, White h
 ad been given advance warning that he was going to be in the big leagues
  for just one day.\n\n\"I handled it as best as I could\,\" said White. 
 \"I tried to give the team the best chance to win. I kind of ran into so
 me trouble in the third. I kind of wish I made better pitches.\"\n\nReli
 ever Mike Stanton was on the mound in the top of the seventh inning when
  he gave up a two-run homer to Eckstein.\n\nSlowly\, the Nationals are p
 utting themselves out of the playoff picture. They are 2 1/2 games behin
 d the Phillies in the National League Wild Card race and 5 1/2 behind th
 e Braves in the division.\n\n\"We are [down] and [the Cardinals] are goi
 ng up\,\" said Robinson. \"We are only hanging around because of what ot
 her teams are not doing\, not what we're doing.\"\n\n\nThis story was no

DESCRIPTION:Loss: 3-4\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nATLANTA -- Missed o
 pportunities and misplays ended up hurting the Nationals\, who lost to t
 he Braves\, 4-3\, in front of 40\,625 at Turner Field on Wednesday night
 .\nThe Nationals\, on a three-game losing streak\, are 3-11 since the Al
 l-Star break. They now find themselves two games behind the Braves in th
 e National League East.\n\nManager Frank Robinson was so upset after the
  game that he scolded the team. He declined to elaborate on what he said
  to his players\, but said that this loss was just as bad as the 10th-in
 ning heartbreaker against the Braves on Tuesday night.\n\n\"We have to w
 in ballgames\, and we are not winning ballgames\, and we are not playing
  winning baseball\,\" said Robinson. \"I had something I had to [say to 
 the players]\, and I got it off my chest and I said it.\"\n\nReliever Jo
 ey Eischen said that Robinson chided the players for not having enough e
 nergy on the field.\n\n\"Hopefully\, people will take heed to what he sa
 id and some of the points he touched on. Hopefully\, there will be some 
 change\,\" said Eischen. \"[Robinson focused on] energy and the intensit
 y that we are taking on the field. Right now\, our opponents are bringin
 g more focused energy than we are\, and that's something we could take c
 are of ourselves. That's something we should not have to practice. That'
 s something you have to bring yourself. That's what he is asking everybo
 dy in this room to do.\"\n\nCenter fielder Brad Wilkerson was more direc
 t\, saying he felt as though a lot of people in the clubhouse don't real
 ize that they are in a pennant race.\n\n\"It's a special moment\, and we
  should seize the moment\,\" said Wilkerson. \"We need to wake up a litt
 le bit. Guys should make sacrifices ... and come here thinking baseball 
 and not make so many mental mistakes. When you make mental mistakes\, it
 's frustrating.\"\n\nThough there were no mental mistakes on Wednesday\,
  the Nationals made physical ones. The biggest one came in the bottom of
  the eighth inning with reliever Gary Majewski on the mound.\n\nWith two
  outs\, Chipper Jones attempted to steal second. Catcher Brian Schneider
  made a perfect throw to shortstop Cristian Guzman\, who dropped the bal
 l\, allowing Jones to reach.\n\n\"I thought I had it\, but at the last s
 econd\, the ball went down a little bit\, and then the ball had a little
  bounce\,\" said Guzman.\n\nAfter Adam LaRoche was walked intentionally\
 , Jeff Francoeur blooped a double to center field to drive in Jones.\n\n
 \"I was supposed to stay inside on Francoeur\, and I did that. It was ju
 st one of those things. The beginning of the season\, it would have been
  a popup to short or second base\,\" said Majewski.\n\nEarlier the Brave
 s had taken advantage of a misplay in the fourth inning. After Marcus Gi
 les hit his eighth home run of the season off Esteban Loaiza to tie the 
 score at 1\, Andruw Jones hit a routine popup between first baseman Nick
  Johnson and second baseman Jose Vidro\, but neither player could see th
 e ball\, and it dropped in for a double. Jones then scored on a two-out 
 single by Francoeur.\n\n\"The ball was hit behind us\, and Nick and I di
 dn't see it\,\" said Vidro.\n\nThen\, in the seventh\, after Francoeur s
 ingled to lead off the inning\, Brian McCann bunted the ball to Loaiza. 
 Instead of getting the sure out at first\, Loaiza went for the force at 
 second\, but threw the ball away and allowed Francoeur to go to third ba
 se.\n\nFrancoeur then scored on a wild pitch by Eischen.\n\n\"The ball w
 as wet a little bit\, and that's why it sank. I didn't get a good throw 
 on it\,\" said Loaiza\, who pitched six-plus innings and gave up three r
 uns -- two earned. \"It's one of those things where I needed to get that
  guy out\, and it didn't work.\"\n\nBut the Nationals came back in the t
 op of the eighth. With runners on first and second\, no outs and Dan Kol
 b on the mound\, Jose Guillen made it a 3-2 game by hitting a single to 
 left to drive in Wilkerson\, the second time in the game he had done so.
  Johnson then singled to left center to drive in Vidro. Both runs were c
 harged to John Foster.\n\nThe Nationals had a golden opportunity to take
  a significant lead against Braves starter Tim Hudson in the first innin
 g\, but they could only muster just one run.\n\nWith one out\, Guillen g
 ave the Nationals a 1-0 lead when he drove in Wilkerson. In the same inn
 ing\, the Nationals had the bases loaded and one out\, but Vinny Castill
 a hit into a double play.\n\n\"How often have we seen that? We couldn't 
 have asked for a better situation in the first inning. As usual\, we cam
 e away with just one run\,\" said Robinson.\n\n\nThis story was not subj

DESCRIPTION:Loss: 5-10\n\nBy Bryan Hoch / MLB.com\n\nNEW YORK -- Frank R
 obinson has been around baseball long enough to spot certain changes in 
 pitchers\, to know when a hurler is favoring an injury or having his del
 ivery disrupted.\n\nDissecting the Nationals' 10-5 loss to the New York 
 Mets on Saturday\, Robinson has come to the ironclad conclusion that rig
 ht-hander Tomo Ohka is pitching hurt.\n\n\"He's not in the strike zone\,
 \" Robinson said. \"He has pitches bouncing up there. It's not like him 
 to go out and throw four straight pitches out of the strike zone. His ve
 locity is down. There has to be something wrong with him.\n\n\"I've seen
  him for three years now. Even when he wasn't pitching well\, he was now
 here close to where he is now.\"\n\nOhka (1-3) barely got through three 
 innings against the Mets and never recorded an out in the fourth\, leavi
 ng a mess for reliever Gary Majewski. The Mets batted around for four ru
 ns in the fourth inning\, leaving Ohka with a line of four runs\, six hi
 ts and his third loss of the season.\n\nNationals team doctor Bruce Thom
 as performed a battery of tests on Ohka\, whose ERA rose to 5.85 with Sa
 turday's defeat\, following his fourth-inning exit and determined that e
 verything checked out normal.\n\nSpeaking with reporters\, Ohka acknowle
 dged that there was something physically bothering him and affecting his
  balance and mechanics\, but that he was not about to reveal exactly wha
 t the ailment was.\n\n\"I don't want to tell you\,\" Ohka said. \"It's O
 K. It's not a big deal for me.\"\n\nAlready up four runs\, New York went
  around the order again in the fifth\, adding six runs -- five earned --
  in a nightmarish 44-pitch inning for Joe Horgan.\n\nDavid Wright shot a
  drive past Vinny Castilla for a run-scoring double\, and Jose Vidro cou
 ldn't find a Victor Diaz popup that was scored an RBI double. Pitcher Ja
 e Seo kept the hit parade going with a two-run single\, and two more run
 s came home when left fielder Tony Blanco slipped and fell chasing a Car
 los Beltran fly ball.\n\n\"It seemed like we kind of gave this game away
 \,\" said outfielder Brad Wilkerson. \"We didn't swing the bats well\, w
 e didn't play good defense and we certainly didn't pitch well.\"\n\nThe 
 Nationals finally got on the board in the sixth when Carlos Baerga singl
 ed a run in off Seo (1-0). The Korean right-hander had an 8.22 ERA at Tr
 iple-A Norfolk before his recall\, taking the start from injured left-ha
 nder Kaz Ishii\, but held Washington to a run on six hits through six in
 nings.\n\n\"Sometimes you put a good pitcher in the Minor Leagues and he
  gets killed\,\" Baerga said. \"[Seo] knows how to pitch in the big leag
 ues.\"\n\nWashington tacked on three runs against reliever Dae-Sung Koo 
 in the seventh. Gary Bennett and Jamey Carroll plated runs with sacrific
 e flies\, while J.J. Davis singled in the Nats' fourth run. Carroll adde
 d another run with a ninth-inning single.\n\nNick Johnson extended his h
 itting streak to 13 games with a 1-for-4 showing.\n\nThis story was not

DESCRIPTION:Win: 8-0\n\nBy Owen Perkins / Special to MLB.com\n\nDENVER -
 - The Nationals picked up a second consecutive victory over the Rockies 
 on Saturday night\, an 8-0 shutout crafted by starter Tony Armas and the
  bullpen. The Nationals assured themselves of their first series win on 
 the road since a sweep of the Cubbies back on July 1-3.\nSaturday night 
 belonged to Armas\, who put on a pitching clinic at Coors Field. After l
 eaving his last start against the Rockies in the third innings\, sufferi
 ng from dizziness and dehydration\, Armas turned the tables in Colorado\
 , throwing dizzying stuff at the Rockies and shutting down their scoring
  game despite pitching through traffic in each of his six shutout inning
 s.\n\nIn each of the first three innings\, the Rockies got men to third 
 but couldn't bring them home\, including a bases-loaded threat with one 
 out in the third\, when the Rockies hit three singles in succession\, bu
 t couldn't plate a run. Armas proved impenetrable\, inducing a pair of f
 ly balls to right to freeze the runners and keep goose eggs on the score
 board.\n\nUltimately\, though the Rockies matched the Nationals' 13 hits
 \, the Nats proved infinitely more efficient at bringing runners home\, 
 leaving only six men on base\, less than half the Rockies' total of 15.\
 n\nThe Nationals offense got going in the second inning\, when former Co
 lorado player Vinny Castilla slammed a run-scoring double off the right 
 field wall and scored on a single to right from Cristian Guzman. It was 
 all the Nats would need\, but they added another pair in the third on ba
 ck-to-back doubles from Jose Vidro and Nick Johnson and an RBI single fr
 om the other ex-Rockie\, Preston Wilson.\n\nThe Nationals added a run ea
 ch in the fifth and sixth and two more in the ninth\, and Mike Stanton\,
  Hector Carrasco\, and Joey Eischen maintained the shutout\, keeping the
  traffic pattern in tact as they stranded a combined six more Rockies ru
 nners.\n\nThis story was not subject to the approval of Major League Bas

DESCRIPTION:Interleague\n\nWin: 6-3\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nANAHE
 IM -- A near-fight between Nationals manager Frank Robinson and Angels s
 kipper Mike Scioscia overshadowed the fact that the Nationals won the ga
 me\, 6-3\, in front of 43\,874 fans at Angel Stadium of Anaheim on Tuesd
 ay night.\nThe Nationals have won 10 of their last 11 games and are in f
 irst place in the National League East\, two games ahead of the Phillies
 .\n\nThe Nationals' accomplishments were minor compared to what happened
  in the top of the seventh inning.\n\nWith Brian Schneider on first base
  and the Angels leading 3-1\, Scioscia decided to take Ervin Santana out
  of the game in favor of right-hander Brendan Donnelly\, who was going t
 o face Carlos Baerga.\n\nRobinson\, however approached home-plate umpire
  Tim Tschida and asked him to inspect Donnelly's glove. About five minut
 es later Donnelly was ejected for a foreign substance.\n\nAfter several 
 minutes of arguing\, Scioscia then called in reliever Scot Shields. But 
 before going back to the dugout\, Scioscia was seen yelling at Robinson 
 near the first-base line and had to be restrained by Tschida before both
  benches and bullpens emptied. There were no punches thrown.\n\nOrder wa
 s restored 10 minutes later\, without the Nationals scoring a run.\n\nIn
  the bottom of the seventh\, Scioscia had the umpires check reliever Gar
 y Majewski's glove and hat for foreign substances\, but nothing was foun

DESCRIPTION:Win: 4-2\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nMIAMI -- About 15 mi
 nutes after the Nationals defeated the Marlins\, 4-2\, at Dolphins Stadi
 um on Sunday afternoon\, manager Frank Robinson lamented what might have
  happened if his team had taken just one game in their recent three-game
  series against the Braves\, and won at least two games against the Marl
 ins.\nIt's easy to figure out. The Nationals would have been just two ga
 mes behind the Braves in the Nationals League instead of five.\n\n\"A [c
 ouple of wins] would have made the difference\,\" Robinson said.\n\nThe 
 good news is that the Nationals are still one game behind the Astros in 
 the Wild Card race thanks to the stalwart pitching of Livan Hernandez\, 
 who tossed eight solid innings\, giving up two runs on 11 hits.\n\nHerna
 ndez struck out five batters and walked one. He threw 145 pitches\, 93 o
 f them for strikes\, to earn his first win since July 1\, when he beat t
 he Cubs at Wrigley Field.\n\n\"When he goes on the mound\, he knows what
  you need\,\" Robinson said. \"He rises to the occasion\, and more often
  than not\, he gives you that performance. He didn't want to come out of
  the game until he went through eight innings\, and then turned it over 
 to [closer Chad Cordero].\"\n\nHernandez did more than just pitch on Sun
 day. He prevented the Marlins from scoring on a squeeze play\, and singl
 ed to drive in an insurance run.\n\nIn the second inning\, Marlins short
 stop Alex Gonzalez was on third base when starter Brian Moehler attempte
 d the squeeze bunt. But Hernandez threw a high fastball\, Moehler missed
  the pitch and catcher Gary Bennett was able to tag out Gonzalez on a ru
 ndown play.\n\n\"I knew something was coming\,\" Hernandez said. \"I tal
 ked to Bennett and I told him I was going to throw a high fastball on th
 e first pitch. I saw Alex go to home plate too early\, and I threw high 
 and Moehler didn't have a chance to bunt.\"\n\nIn the fifth inning\, the
  Nationals had a 2-1 lead when the Marlins decided to walk Cristian Guzm
 an to load the bases and pitch to Hernandez. But Hernandez\, who won the
  Silver Slugger last season\, came through with a base hit to right fiel
 d to drive in Carlos Baerga.\n\n\"I go to home plate and I want to make 
 contact. I don't want to be an easy out\,\" Hernandez said. \"On the fir
 st pitch\, he threw a fastball up the middle and then he threw me a fast
 ball again and I'll take it. I would never throw a fastball in that situ
 ation.\"\n\nBefore Hernandez's key hit\, Baerga was the one who gave the
  Nationals the lead. With the score tied at 1 in the top of the fifth\, 
 Baerga singled to right field to drive in Jose Guillen.\n\n\"We needed t
 o come back today and get some key hits\,\" Baerga said. \"Livan kept us
  in the game the whole time. He pitched a great game. It was a big one f
 or us. Now we have a day off tomorrow and then we go home.\"\n\nThe Marl
 ins made it a 3-2 game in the bottom of the sixth inning when Paul Lo Du
 ca singled home Mike Lowell.\n\nNick Johnson gave the Nationals a two-ru
 n lead again when he homered off Guillermo Mota in the ninth. At first\,
  it appeared Johnson wasn't going to get an at-bat in the inning. In the
  bottom of the sixth\, Johnson hurt his right heel catching a Gonzalez l
 ine drive. It's the same heel that kept him on the disabled list for a m
 onth. Trainer Tim Abraham came to Johnson's aid\, but the first baseman 
 remainedin the game.\n\nRobinson credited Johnson for realizing how much
  the team needed him on the field.\n\n\"Nick knew what we needed\, and w
 e needed him in the lineup\,\" Robinson said. \"We needed him to take hi
 s at-bats and we needed him on the field. But he said\, 'If I'm in scori
 ng position\, it would be better to run for me.' And I understood that. 
 That's a huge hit. We have been missing those hits.\"\n\nJohnson was tip
 toeing after the game\, but he expects to get some treatment during Mond
 ay's off-day and play against the Dodgers on Tuesday.\n\nThis story was

 .com\n\nTORONTO -- Claudio Vargas started strong\, but one bad pitch sen
 t his start into a tailspin.\nPitching on two days' rest\, Vargas breeze
 d through the first three innings of Friday's Interleague opener against
  the Toronto Blue Jays\, facing just one batter over the minimum.\n\nHe'
 d retired nine straight before Shea Hillenbrand's two-out single in the 
 fourth. Then the wheels came off.\n\nStruggling to close out the inning\
 , Vargas (0-2) left a pitch up to Toronto's Vernon Wells\, who blasted a
  second-deck home run to left\, one of two homers by Wells in the Blue J
 ays' 6-1 victory.\n\n\"I don't know what happened\,\" said Nationals cat
 cher Brian Schneider. \"That's the thing with this game. You make one ba
 d pitch\, and it changes the whole game around. That's what [Vargas] did
  that inning\; he left that ball there for Vernon to hit\, and it cascad
 ed from there.\"\n\nEric Hinske followed with a double inside the bag at
  first\, and Russ Adams was intentionally walked to bring up Aaron Hill\
 , who was making his Major League debut. Hill delivered a two-run triple
  over a surprisingly shallow outfield\, then scored one batter later whe
 n Cristian Guzman couldn't handle Ken Huckaby's grounder.\n\nThat was th
 e end for Vargas\, who was replaced by Jon Rauch.\n\nVargas\, who lasted
  just 1 1/3 innings against Milwaukee on Tuesday\, denied that fatigue h
 ad done him in.\n\n\"I got in trouble because in the last inning\, I sta
 rted to throw the ball up\,\" he said. \"Sometimes when I try to do too 
 much\, that's a problem.\"\n\nVargas threw 63 pitches in his 3 2/3 innin
 gs\, allowing five runs on six hits. He walked two\, one intentional\, a
 nd didn't strike out a batter.\n\nManager Frank Robinson didn't hide his
  frustration with Vargas' fourth-inning meltdown.\n\n\"You certainly don
 't expect that\,\" he said. \"You should be able to get an out\, but he 
 wasn't.\n\n\"You give up five runs in an inning\, you're not going to wi
 n too many ballgames like that.\"\n\nCompounding the problem was Washing
 ton's inability to string any hits together against Toronto starter Ted 
 Lilly. The lefty hadn't won since April 26 and was skipped in his last s
 cheduled start after not getting out of the second inning in two straigh
 t outings.\n\nVinny Castilla\, who doubled in the fourth and later score
 d Washington's lone run\, gave Lilly credit.\n\n\"What can I say? He pit
 ched good\,\" Castilla said. \"He made pitches when he needed to and got
  himself out of trouble.\"\n\nLilly struck out eight over six innings an
 d lowered his ERA from 10.41 to 8.82.\n\n\"He was aggressive\,\" said Sc
 hneider. \"He was throwing the fastball away and getting ahead of guys.\
 "\n\nThe Nationals squandered the chance to score more in the fourth\, p
 utting two men on with just one out\, but both Schneider and Guzman stru
 ck out.\n\n\"We're just not taking advantage of the opportunities and ge
 tting that big hit on a consistent basis\,\" Robinson said. \"We had a l
 ittle opening there\, we just didn't advantage of it.\"\n\nThe return of
  the former Montreal Expos did little to boost attendance on a warm spri
 ng evening in Toronto. Just 17\,465 fans took in the game on the beginni
 ng of a holiday weekend in Canada.\n\nThis story was not subject to the

 BURGH -- Washington Nationals general manager Jim Bowden wondered aloud 
 in the dugout before Tuesday's game how the Texas Rangers could have giv
 en up on Ryan Drese\, their Opening Day starter\, who won 14 games and l
 ogged 207 2/3 innings last season.\nAfter Texas waived Drese two weeks a
 go\, the Nationals nabbed him and the 29-year-old came through with eigh
 t innings of two-hit shutout ball in his Washington debut\, a 1-0 victor
 y over the Angels last Wednesday.\n\nDrese's second start\, however\, wa
 s not as successful.\n\nIn fact\, it was not even close. Drese lasted on
 ly three-plus innings and allowed five earned runs on eight hits and two
  walks in an 11-4 loss to the Pittsburgh Pirates.\n\n\"He made it look s
 o easy [last week]\,\" Nationals manager Frank Robinson said. \"He kept 
 the ball down. Tonight\, he kept the ball down in the first inning\, but
  there were three ground balls hit but not at people. If those are hit r
 ight at somebody\, maybe it would have made a difference in the game.\"\
 n\nBrian Schneider and Jose Guillen each had two hits\, and Guillen adde
 d two RBIs and Brad Wilkerson scored three runs in a losing cause for th
 e Nationals\, who fell to 4-4 on a nine-game road trip that concludes We
 dnesday afternoon in Pittsburgh.\n\n\"It was a tough night\,\" Robinson 
 said. \"You will not win too many games playing like that.\"\n\nThings s
 tarted off well enough for Washington\, as Wilkerson led off the game wi
 th a home run for the first time this season. He took a 3-2 pitch into t
 he right-center-field seats\, his fourth\, off Pirates starter Oliver Pe
 rez (6-5).\n\nBut the Pirates took the lead in the bottom of the inning\
 , when Daryle Ward's groundout scored Bobby Hill\, and Jose Castillo's s
 ingle drove in Jason Bay.\n\n\"When you score\, you like your pitching t
 o shut the other club down\,\" Robinson said. \"You get a chance to get 
 an edge and some momentum and then what happens is you give it to the ot
 her guys\, and that kind of picks them up.\"\n\nThe clubs traded leads a
 gain in the third inning. In the top of the frame\, Guillen doubled home
  Wilkerson and Marlon Byrd to give Washington a 3-2 advantage. But back-
 to-back doubles by Hill and Bay tied the game at 3 in the bottom of the 
 inning\, and two groundouts later\, Bay scored to put Pittsburgh back on
  top\, 4-3.\n\n\"I was making my pitches and getting groundballs\,\" Dre
 se (5-7) said. \"But I was really upset I hung two curveballs for double
 s in the third inning. Those were the only two bad pitches I made tonigh
 t.\"\n\nJack Wilson ended Drese's night with a double to lead off the fo
 urth. Wilson scored two batters later on a Matt Lawton groundout.\n\n\"W
 e were in the game all night\,\" Drese said. \"They just fought hard. It
  was a grind out there.\"\n\nWashington loaded the bases with one out in
  the seventh but settled for only one run -- a Vinny Castilla sacrifice 
 fly to score Wilkerson that pulled the Nationals to within one run\, 5-4
 .\n\nBut Lawton's two-run homer in the bottom of the inning gave the Pir
 ates insurance. Pittsburgh looked to add another run\, but Hill was thro
 wn out at home on Castillo's fly ball to center. Schneider received a th
 row that was slightly high from Wilkerson\, but home plate umpire Dana D
 eMuth ruled Hill did not get under the catcher's tag.\n\nPittsburgh mana
 ger Lloyd McClendon came out to argue the call and was ejected for the t
 hird time this season after kicking dirt over home plate.\n\nThe contest
 ed play at the plate proved inconsequential for Pittsburgh\, when double
 s by Lawton and Ward pushed four more across in the eighth.\n\n\"We lost
 . They played better than us\,\" Guillen said. \"Give those guys credit.
  They swung the bats well today.\n\n\"We were not able to do things like
  move runners over and sometimes [we] couldn't make good pitches. But [P
 ittsburgh] came up with some outstanding hitting\, and they pitched well
  enough to win the ballgame.\"\n\nThis story was not subject to the appr

 d opportunities ended up hurting the Nationals\, who lost to the Mets\, 
 3-2\, in 11 innings at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium on Thursday afternoon.\
 nWith the Mets taking three out of four games\, it's the first time the 
 Nationals have lost a series at home since April 25-27\, when they lost 
 two out of three to the Phillies.\n\nThe box score said that the Nationa
 ls lost Thursday's game in the 11th inning\, when the Mike Piazza took a
  1-0 pitch from Luis Ayala and blooped the ball to short-right field to 
 score Carlos Beltran and give the Mets the 3-2 lead.\n\nBut the game was
  lost a few innings earlier. The Nationals had chances to score runs in 
 the second\, fifth and ninth innings\, but couldn't capitalize on the op
 portunities.\n\nIn the second\, with Mets starter Kris Benson on the mou
 nd\, the Nationals had runners on first and third and one out\, but Marl
 on Byrd hit into a double play to end the inning.\n\nThe way Vinny Casti
 lla saw it\, Washington should have had a run before Byrd hit into the d
 ouble play.\n\nWith one out\, Castilla hit a ball that bounced on top of
  the 380-foot sign in left-center field. Castilla had to settle for a do
 uble\, but he felt in any other ballpark\, he would have had his seventh
  home run of the season. RFK Stadium continues to prove that it is a pit
 cher's park.\n\n\"The ball would have been way out in any other ballpark
  in America\,\" Castilla said. \"I crushed this ball and it's a double.\
 "\n\nIn the fifth inning\, with the score tied at 2\, Matt Cepicky led o
 ff with a double. Manager Frank Robinson asked pitcher Tony Armas Jr. to
  get the bunt down to advance Cepicky to third. However\, Armas had a di
 fficult time getting the job done.\n\nAfter Armas got behind 0-2\, Robin
 son came out of the dugout and told Armas to get the bunt down on the gr
 ound and not to try to aim it at a certain spot. Robinson's words of wis
 dom didn't work as Armas fanned for the first out of the inning.\n\n\"Be
 nson threw three cutters that were nasty\,\" Armas said. \"What can I sa
 y? It was a tough pitch to bunt.\"\n\nAfter Wilkerson flied out\, Jamey 
 Carroll singled and Jose Vidro walked to load the bases. But Baerga boun
 ced out to Benson to end the inning.\n\nThe Nationals had a chance to wi
 n the game in the bottom of the ninth inning. They had runners on first 
 and second and one out. But Jose Guillen flied out to Beltran in center 
 field and Wilkerson checked his swing\, but grounded out to David Wright
  for the force play at third.\n\n\"It was a bad pitch and I kind of chec
 k swung\,\" Wilkerson said. \"I thought maybe it was a foul ball. It was
  frustrating to have the count in your favor. It was an unfortunate situ
 ation. It hit the bat and went fair.\"\n\nWith three games left in the f
 irst half\, Robinson hopes the offensive lull will come to an end agains
 t the Phillies in Philadelphia.\n\n\"If this series doesn't fire us up\,
  I don't know what will\,\" Robinson said. \"They understand what's happ
 ening here. I shouldn't have to go and fire them up. I may say something
  before Friday's game\, but I shouldn't have to. They should understand 
 what's going on here and why we lost these games\, and we should try to 
 do something about it.\"\n\nArmas\, who didn't figure in the decision\, 
 started for the Nationals and had his second consecutive quality outing.
  He pitched seven innings and gave up two runs on two hits.\n\nThe Mets 
 manufactured their first run in the first inning. After Jose Reyes walke
 d\, stole second and went to third on a sacrifice by Mike Cameron\, Belt
 ran grounded out to Carroll at shortstop\, but Reyes scored on the play.
 \n\nBenson also was solid for the Mets as he pitched seven innings and g
 ave up two runs on seven hits.\n\nThe Nationals scored those two runs in
  the bottom of the third inning. With runners on first and third\, Vidro
  doubled to left-center field to score Armas and Wilkerson.\n\nThe Mets

 neider's home run in the top of the 12th inning helped the Nationals def
 eat the Cubs\, 5-4\, and sweep the three-game series in front of 40\,006
  at Wrigley Field on Sunday afternoon.\nThe last time the Nationals swep
 t the Cubs at Wrigley Field was June 3-5\, 1994\, when they were known a
 s the Expos.\n\nThe Nationals have now won six consecutive games and are
  the third team in the Major Leagues to reach the 50-win plateau this se
 ason. They return to Washington with a 50-31 record.\n\nWith two outs in
  the 12th\, Schneider took Cubs reliever Sergio Mitre deep over the righ
 t-field wall on a 1-0 pitch. It was his sixth home run of the season.\n\
 n\"Mitre has some movement on the ball\,\" Schneider said. \"You are loo
 king for a good pitch to hit\, and he left the ball up in the zone and I
  put a good swing on it.\"\n\nSchneider is hitting over .360 since June 
 1 to raise his batting average to .271.\n\n\"He has been coming on. He h
 as been getting good pitches to hit\, and he is putting good swings on t
 he pitches\,\" manager Frank Robinson said of Schneider. \"He has an ide
 a what he wants to do up at home plate.\"\n\nThe winning pitcher was Joe
 y Eischen\, while Mitre took the loss.\n\nD.C. starter Ryan Drese had an
 other outstanding outing\, pitching seven shutout innings. He gave up fo
 ur hits and struck out one batter. But strikeouts are not Drese's game\;
  he's a sinkerball pitcher\, and he induced eight groundball outs.\n\n\"
 He did another outstanding job\, and that's very encouraging before the 
 All-Star break and after the All-Star break\,\" Robinson said. \"It's ni
 ce to know that we have a solid guy going there with the other three guy
 s [Livan Hernandez\, John Patterson and Esteban Loaiza]. Hopefully\, we'
 ll get Tony Armas going.\"\n\nThe Nationals gave Drese early run support
  against Cubs starter Carlos Zambrano. With two outs in the first inning
 \, Junior Spivey scored all the way from first base on a double by Vinny
  Castilla.\n\nIn the fourth inning\, Schneider made it a 2-0 game when h
 e singled to left field to drive in Jose Guillen.\n\nBut\, starting with
  Chad Cordero in the ninth inning\, the Nationals relievers\, a corps th
 at has been virtually unhittable for most of the season\, had a tough ti
 me getting the job done.\n\nEntering the game\, Cordero had converted a 
 franchise record 26 consecutive saves\, but the streak was ended when Ar
 amis Ramirez hit a two-run homer over the left-center field wall. It was
  Cordero's first blown save since April 21 against the Braves.\n\nAs Ram
 irez was circling the bases\, Cordero was spotted biting the front of hi
 s shirt for about 10 seconds. After the inning ended with the score tied
  at 2\, Cordero was seen banging his glove on top of the dugout.\n\n\"It
  was frustrating. Ryan was battling the whole game. He pitched great. I 
 felt bad for him\,\" Cordero said. \"After that\, I was fine. It's all p
 art of the game.\"\n\nThe team then rallied behind their \"savior.\"\n\n
 \"Nobody was down. The cry was\, 'Let's pick Chief [Cordero] up. He has 
 been carrying us. We'll pick him up today\,' \" Robinson said.\n\nIt loo
 ked like the Nationals were going to win the game in the top of the 11th
  inning\, when they rallied for two runs with Glendon Rusch on the mound
 .\n\nWith Carlos Baerga on first base and no outs\, Schneider hit a perf
 ect double-play ball to second baseman Todd Walker\, but Walker threw th
 e ball away to left field\, leaving the Nationals with runners on second
  and third and no outs.\n\nOne out later\, after Wil Cordero walked inte
 ntionally to load the bases\, Brad Wilkerson doubled over the head of ce
 nter fielder Jerry Hairston to score Baerga and Schneider.\n\nBut the Cu
 bs made their second comeback of the game in the bottom of the inning ag
 ainst right-hander Hector Carrasco.\n\nHairston made it a one-run game w
 hen he hit his third home run of the season to lead off the inning.\n\nT
 hen with two out\, both Jeromy Burnitz and Ramirez singled to put runner
 s on first and third.\n\nEischen then came into the game and gave up a b
 roken-bat double to Todd Hollandsworth. Burnitz scored on the play.\n\n\
 "The relievers are human beings. Also\, you have to give the other team 
 credit\, too. Sometimes they put in a good swing\, and they are going to
  have success against relievers\, no matter what\,\" Robinson said. \"Bu
 t the one thing about it is\, we held together as a team. We won a tough

 ton\, the Nationals were the feel-good story of the first half of 2005. 
 They were 52-36 and in first place in the National League East. They wer
 e getting solid pitching and timely hitting on a regular basis.\nA coupl
 e of days before the All-Star break\, manager Frank Robinson warned his 
 team not to relax because teams in the East would be gunning for them.\n
 \nRobinson was proven right. Not only did they lose their division and W
 ild Card leads\, the Nationals went 28-45 after the break and were elimi
 nated from playoff contention on Sept. 26. Still\, Washington finished w
 ith a .500 record.\n\nRecord: 81-81\, fifth in NL East.\n\nDefining mome
 nt: The Nationals can look at their game against the Padres on Sept.17 a
 s the turning point of the season. Washington blew a 5-0 lead in the nin
 th before losing\, 8-5\, in 12 innings.\n\nIt was a game that left peopl
 e second-guessing Robinson for a while. He made too many pitching change
 s in the ninth inning\, and the Padres took advantage of the situation t
 o put five runs on the board.\n\nRobinson would later apologize to the t
 eam and admit that he should have started the inning by using closer Cha
 d Cordero. The Nationals would lose seven of their next eight games befo
 re being eliminated from the Wild Card race.\n\nWhat went right: The Nat
 ionals' pitching staff was consistent all season\, even though Robinson 
 was forced to use a four-man rotation because of injuries by September. 
 Washington ended up fourth in the National League in ERA.\n\nWhat went w
 rong: The poor offense was overlooked in the first half of the season be
 cause the Nationals had one of the best records in baseball. But the bat
 s were the main reason they fell out of the race after the All-Star brea
 k. The Nats finished last in the Major Leagues in almost every offensive
  category.\n\nBiggest surprise: At the All-Star break\, right-hander Hec
 tor Carrasco was 3-2 with a 2.43 ERA\, and he said he was going to be ev
 en better. In September\, Robinson put Carrasco in the rotation\, where 
 he gave up six runs in 26 2/3 innings and posted a 2-1 record. Carrasco 
 credited his success to pitching coach Randy St. Claire\, who taught him
  how to command a deadly changeup.\n\nSTATISTICAL LEADERS\nBatting\nAver
 age: Nick Johnson\, .289\nDoubles: Brad Wilkerson\, 42\nTriples: Brad Wi
 lkerson\, 7\nHome runs: Preston Wilson\, 25\nRuns: Jose Guillen\, 81\nRB
 Is: Preston Wilson\, 90\nStolen bases: Junior Spivey\, 9\n\nPitching\nWi
 ns: Livan Hernandez\, 15\nLosses: Esteban Loaiza\, Livan Hernandez\, 10\
 nERA (starter): John Patterson\, 3.13\nERA (reliever): Hector Carrasco\,
  2.04\nSaves: Chad Cordero\, 47\n\nFORECAST FOR 2006\nLineup: The Nation
 als need to make a lot of improvements\, and the starting eight is expec
 ted to be overhauled. Third baseman Vinny Castilla and Preston Wilson li
 kely won't be back and the club has to determine if players such as Brad
  Wilkerson\, Cristian Guzman\, Marlon Byrd and Ryan Church will ever rea
 ch their potential.\n\nRotation: As good as the rotation was\, they need
  two more starters because Tony Armas Jr. isn't likely to return\, and R
 yan Drese and Jon Rauch will be coming off shoulder problems. When Septe
 mber began\, the Nationals had only three starters in the rotation becau
 se of injuries. Washington was then forced to put Carrasco in the rotati
 on.\n\nBullpen: The bright spot of the team\, led by closer Cordero and 
 setup men Gary Majewski and Luis Ayala. The big question is\, can they a
 fford to keep Carrasco and Joey Eischen\, who are free agents? Robinson 
 said he would love to see the Nationals get a powerful left-handed relie
 ver. If they can't get one in the free agent market\, Washington might h
 ave to promote Bill Bray\, the franchise's No 1 pick in the 2004 First-Y
 ear Player Draft.\n\nBiggest need: The Nationals need a leadoff hitter w
 ith speed and at least two impact sluggers. They thought they had at lea
 st one slugger in Wilson\, but he was too inconsistent. Whether they acq
 uire those players will depend on new ownership\, which was not determin
 ed at the end of the season.\n\nProspect to watch: If the month of Septe
 mber was any indication\, third baseman Ryan Zimmerman is going to be a 
 star in the years to come. He hit over .400 with six RBIs. On defense\, 
 Zimmerman has shown why interim general manager Jim Bowden has compared 
 him to Scott Rolen\, Brooks Robinson and Mike Schmidt at third base. Zim
 merman was flawless at the position.\n\nThis story was not subject to th

DESCRIPTION:Win: 7-3\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- Nick J
 ohnson's RBI single in the fifth inning helped the Nationals defeat the 
 Marlins\, 7-3\, in front of 33\,198 at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium on Satu
 rday night.\nThe Nationals have now won six of their last seven games\, 
 moving them past the Marlins into second place in the National League Ea
 st and just one-half game behind the Braves\, who defeated the Pirates o
 n Saturday.\n\nBut strange behavior by Nationals center fielder Marlon B
 yrd and right-hander Tomo Ohka nearly overshadowed the game. Byrd knocke
 d down second base umpire Joe Brinkman after the sixth inning and Ohka s
 howed up manager Frank Robinson earlier in the fourth.\n\nByrd was eject
 ed after arguing with first base umpire Bill Miller\, who called Byrd ou
 t on a swinging strike. Byrd ran from shallow left field to argue with M
 iller. But Brinkman\, who is the crew chief\, tried to grab Byrd and was
  knocked to the ground. Nationals trainer Tim Abraham and Marlins traine
 r Sean Cunningham attended to Brinkman\, who suffered a scrape on his ri
 ght forehead\, but remained in the game.\n\n\"This game won't be oversha
 dowed if you guys write it and make a big deal out of it\,\" Robinson sa
 id. \"I think the most important thing for us is to win a ballgame\, not
  Marlon Byrd getting thrown out of a ballgame. It's a sidebar.\"\n\nRobi
 nson said he didn't see the incident with Byrd and Brinkman. All Robinso
 n saw was that Brinkman was on the ground.\n\n\"All Brinkman said was he
  was not as quick as he used to be. He couldn't get over there to stop h
 im\,\" Robinson said. \"Brinkman didn't seem like he was upset or annoye
 d by it. He was in good spirits.\"\n\nAs for Ohka\, he became the second
  Nationals pitcher this season to show his frustrations on the mound in 
 front of Robinson. On May 3\, in Los Angeles\, right-hander Zach Day tur
 ned his back on Robinson as the skipper was taking Day out of the game. 
 Day was not disciplined\, but was demoted to the bullpen before being se
 nt down to the Minor Leagues.\n\nOn Saturday\, Ohka also had his back tu
 rned as Robinson walked toward the mound to take out the hurler. But unl
 ike the day in Los Angeles\, Robinson snatched the ball out of Ohka's ha
 nd.\n\n\"We will deal with it privately and we will try to keep that in-
 house. It's something I will not tolerate\,\" Robinson said.\n\nThanks t
 o a Vinny Castilla three-run double\, Ohka had a 3-1 lead after the open
 ing frame. But he couldn't hold on to it as he gave up an RBI double to 
 Juan Pierre and a home run to Juan Encarnacion in the second and third i
 nnings\, respectively.\n\nOhka's misfortune turned out to be a coup for 
 right-hander Sunny Kim\, who stopped the bleeding Ohka created by pitchi
 ng 3 1/3 scoreless innings\, striking out four.\n\n\"It was an outstandi
 ng effort on his part. He picked us all up\,\" Robinson said of Kim. \"H
 e hasn't been out there much since he has been up here. He was very shar
 p. You could say he won the ballgame for us.\"\n\nKim (1-0) became the w
 inning pitcher\, thanks to the hitting heroics of Johnson\, who went 2-f
 or-3.\n\nThe game was tied at 3 in the bottom of the fifth inning\, when
  Johnson singled to center field off starter Al Leiter (2-6) to drive in
  Jamey Carroll and give the Nationals a 4-3 lead.\n\n\"Nick has been in 
 the middle of a lot of things lately\, and he continues to get big hits 
 for us and put good wood on the ball\,\" Robinson said. \"He is in a ver
 y good rhythm right now and I hope it continues.\"\n\nJohnson added to t
 he lead in the seventh inning off Guillermo Mota with a single to drive 
 in Carroll.\n\n\"I'm just swinging at good pitches\,\" Johnson said. \"M
 ota throws real hard and he has a great changeup. I was trying to battle
 .\"\n\nIn the bottom of the eighth\, the Nationals added two more runs o
 n an RBI single by Cristian Guzman and an RBI double by Tony Blanco.\n\n

SUMMARY:(W) vs Reds
DESCRIPTION:Win: 5-3\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- John P
 atterson's nickname is The Big Nasty\, and he was just that against the 
 Reds on Wednesday night. The right-hander threw 8 1/3 solid innings and 
 helped the Nationals defeat the Reds\, 5-3\, in front of 32\,641 at RFK 
 Stadium.\nIt was the Nationals' first victory against the Reds this seas
 on.\n\nDuring the game\, Patterson (8-4) admitted that he came close to 
 cracking because he was in another close one\, but he kept his composure
 \, and gave up three runs on 10 hits\, striking out eight and walking on
 e. He wasn't able to relax until the ninth inning.\n\n\"I was under some
  stress there for while\, but it was a good game\,\" said Patterson. \"P
 lus\, we were able to score late\, and it took some pressure off me. Aft
 er that\, I started to be aggressive.\"\n\nHis biggest test came in the 
 seventh inning. The Reds had the bases loaded and no outs\, but Patterso
 n managed to get out of the inning. Edwin Encarnacion hit a grounder to 
 first baseman Nick Johnson\, who threw to catcher Brian Schneider to get
  Sean Casey at the plate.\n\nJacob Cruz\, pinch-hitting for starter Ramo
 n Ortiz\, struck out\, and Felipe Lopez grounded out to end the inning.\
 n\n\"After the bases were loaded\, I tried to get tough\,\" said Patters
 on. \"I threw a curveball to [Encarnacion]. Jacob Cruz hasn't seen me. I
  went soft early and hard late [in the at-bat]. I got the strikeout. If 
 Lopez was going to beat me\, he was going to beat me with the fastball. 
 I made two good pitches on the fastball\, and I got him to roll over on 
 it. It was the turning point of the game. It was a big spot.\"\n\nDuring
  the second half of the season\, Patterson has been performing like the 
 Nationals' No. 1 starter. Asked if he felt like an ace\, he said\, \"I l
 ike to compete. One\, two\, three\, four\, five\, wherever you fit in th
 e rotation\, I don't think that would really matter. You should take som
 e pride in your job and do [it to] the best of your ability.\"\n\nPatter
 son was also able to get some run support. With Ortiz on the mound in th
 e fifth and the score tied at 1\, Jose Guillen hit a solo home run over 
 the left-field fence. It was his second home run at RFK Stadium in as ma
 ny days and only his third overall in his home ballpark this season.\n\n
 For most of the season\, Guillen was known as the player who complained 
 about the dimensions at RFK\, saying that they were too far. Asked if pl
 aying there was no longer an issue\, now that he is starting to hit home
  runs\, he said\, \"I don't have an issue with the stadium. It's just th
 at some players get benefits in the stadium that they play. I was just o
 ne of the guys that wasn't getting the benefits of this stadium. Everybo
 dy wants to play at a stadium where they can put up the numbers.\n\n\"Th
 is stadium has taken a lot of home runs away from me. I just never tried
  to make that an excuse. I never did\, and I never will. I just play my 
 game the way it is and try to help this team to win.\"\n\nIn the seventh
 \, with reliever Jason Standridge on the mound\, the Nationals scored th
 ree more runs\, with Schneider driving in one with a single to left and 
 Vinny Castilla driving in two more with a double to right-center.\n\nIt 
 seems that whenever the right-handed-hitting Castilla goes the other way
 \, good things happen. When he tries to pull the ball all the time\, he 
 doesn't have much success.\n\n\"You want a hit so bad\, you forget to hi
 t the other way\,\" said Castilla. \"If it were that easy\, no one would
  go into slumps. I got a pretty good slider to go the other way\, and I 
 did that.\"\n\nIn the ninth\, Patterson gave up a two-run homer to Javie
 r Valentin and exited in favor of Chad Cordero\, who struck out the last
  two hitters of the game to pick up his 40th save of the season.\n\nCord
 ero is now the fourth reliever in Nationals/Expos history to record 40 s
 aves in a season. Jeff Reardon (1985)\, Ugueth Urbina (1999) and John We
 tteland (1993) are the others to have reached that milestone.\n\n\"I nev
 er thought I was going to reach 40 [saves]\,\" said Cordero. \"I was abl
 e to get that\, and it's pretty cool. I wouldn't have been able to do it
  if we were not winning. We found a way to end a good night for the team
 . It help us get on the right track.\"\n\n\nThis story was not subject t

DESCRIPTION:Loss: 0-3\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON D.C. -- 
 Right-hander Esteban Loaiza pitched his best game of the season\, but th
 e Nationals were blanked by the Phillies\, 3-0\, in front 27\,483 at Rob
 ert F. Kennedy Stadium on Wednesday.\n\nBefore the game\, Loaiza request
 ed that the Nationals wear their practice jerseys\, which are red and bl
 ue\, instead of the home red and white jerseys. The change of pace worke
 d for a while\, as Loaiza looked like the pitcher who won 21 games for t
 he White Sox in 2003.\n\nLoaiza tied his careerhigh for strikeouts by fa
 nning 11 batters through eight innings. He almost had a no-hitter going 
 into the ninth. However\, in the second inning\, Jason Michaels hit a we
 ak ground ball that went past second baseman Jose Vidro for a base hit. 
 Vidro positioned himself close to second base and he had a go far to his
  left to get the ball.\n\nIn the eighth\, Michaels hit a fly ball to lef
 t-center field. Both Terrmel Sledge and Ryan Church couldn't see the bal
 l and it fell in for a base hit.\n\n\"I was getting ahead of the count a
 nd throwing my pitches for strikes. The game is not over until the last 
 out is made\,\" Loaiza said.\n\nManager Frank Robinson felt Loaiza was s
 harp enough to pitch the ninth inning. Loaiza threw 105 pitches going in
 to that inning\, but didn't retire a batter. Jimmy Rollins led off and h
 it a solo home run over the right-field fence.\n\n\"I was not tired. I t
 hrew just 115 pitches\,\" Loaiza said. \"It was supposed to be a cutter 
 away\, but it came back inside and Rollins took advantage of it. One bad
  pitch cost me the game.\"\n\nLoaiza left the game a few minutes later a
 fter he gave up a single to Kenny Lofton. Loaiza was later charged with 
 another run when Luis Ayala gave up an RBI single to David Bell.\n\n\"I 
 felt Loaiza had a low pitch count. I thought he was throwing very well a
 nd he deserved to go back out there in the ninth inning\,\" Robinson sai
 d.\n\nTwo batters later\, Placido Polanco drove in another run with a si
 ngle\, which was charged to Joey Eischen.\n\nIn all\, Loaiza pitched eig
 ht-plus innings and gave up two runs on four hits.\n\n\"You are very dis
 appointed that Loaiza took the loss and it's a tough loss for the ballcl
 ub\,\" Robinson said. \"He pitched an outstanding game and we lost. We c
 an't afford to lose games like that. Those are the games we have to win.
  We have to put one or two runs on the board to allow our pitchers to co
 me away with a win. \"\n\nThe Nationals said there was a reason they cou
 ldn't score a run on Wednesday. The game started at 4:35 p.m. and the hi
 tters' from both sides had a tough seeing the baseball because the shado
 ws at home plate and the glare off the hitters background. The outfielde
 rs even had a tough time seeing high fly balls.\n\nNationals third basem
 an Vinny Castilla said he could only see a \"black dot\" when the ball w
 as approaching home plate.\n\n\"I couldn't see the spin of the ball. It 
 was very tough day to hit. The whole game was like that\,\" Castilla sai
 d.\n\nSaid Vidro\, \"I don't know who's idea was it tough play at 4:35\,
  but it was tough. I didn't know it was going to be that bad. It was a b
 attle for is\, but we have no excuses. It was a battle just to make cont
 act. It's unfortunate\, we could score for Loaiza.\"\n\nRobinson tried t
 o get answers as to why the game started at 4:35\, but the powers that b
 e had none.\n\n\"I'm not going to name the names\, but nobody could tell
  me why the game was played at 4:35\,\" Robinson said. \"It's very diffi
 cult for the hitters to pick up the spin of the ball\, when they are sta
 nding in darkness and there's bright light in center field. It's tough e
 nough in batting practice.\"\n\nPhillies starter Brett Myers took advant
 age of the situation. He pitched seven shutout innings\, but didn't figu
 re in the decision. He struck out seven batters and walked three.\n\nThe
 ir best chance to score off Myers occurred in the first inning. Church w
 as on third base with one out\, but Vidro struck out and Jose Guillen gr
 ounded out to end the inning.\n\n\"I don't think anyone realized how big
  that would be because going into the ninth inning\, we would be leading
  1-0\,\" Robinson said.\n\nThe winning pitcher was Rheal Cormier\, who p
 itched one shutout inning. Closer Billy Wagner pitched the ninth and ret
 ired the Nationals in order.\n\nThe Nationals fell to 11-11\, while the 
 Phillies raised their record to 10-12.\n\nThis story was not subject to

DESCRIPTION:Win: 7-4\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nNEW YORK -- Manager 
 Frank Robinson thought that Sunday's game against the Mets was not going
  to be easy\, because his starter\, Esteban Loaiza\, was pitching on thr
 ee days' rest.\nRobinson was proven wrong\, as the Nationals defeated th
 e Mets\, 7-4\, in front of 42\,412 at Shea Stadium on Sunday afternoon t
 o salvage the three-game series.\n\nThe Nationals now find themselves 5 
 games behind the Braves in the National League East and 1 1/2 games behi
 nd the Phillies in the NL Wild Card race.\n\nAt first it looked as thoug
 h the Nationals were going to have an easy day\, as they sent 11 men to 
 the plate in the first to face right-hander Kris Benson\, who had the sh
 ortest outing of his career. Benson lasted two-thirds of an inning and g
 ave up six runs on eight hits.\n\nWashington scored the first run of the
  game when Nick Johnson drove in Ryan Church with a sacrifice fly. It wa
 s the second out of the inning.\n\nBenson couldn't get anybody out after
  that. After Jose Guillen doubled\, Preston Wilson gave the Nationals a 
 2-0 lead when he doubled to right-center to send Guillen home.\n\nWilson
  then scored on a Vinny Castilla single. Later in the inning\, Cristian 
 Guzman sent two runners home with a double\, and Loaiza had an RBI singl
 e.\n\nIt took Juan Padilla to stop the bleeding\, by getting Jose Vidro 
 to fly out to end the inning.\n\nIt was the second consecutive game in w
 hich the Nationals scored six runs in an inning.\n\nThe Nationals made i
 t a 7-0 game in the fifth\, when Church walked with the bases loaded to 
 force home Castilla.\n\n\"With Loaiza going\, and not knowing what he wa
 s going to give me\, it was outstanding to see those runs go up on the b
 oard\,\" said Robinson.\n\nLoaiza\, pitching on short rest because of th
 e rainout on Tuesday in Philadelphia\, went 6 1/3 innings and gave up th
 ree runs on seven hits. All three runs were scored in the fifth inning\,
  when pinch-hitter Mike Jacobs\, making his Major League debut\, hit a t
 hree-run home run.\n\n\"All I had in my mind was to put zeroes on the bo
 ard\,\" said Loaiza. \"With the lead\, you are really comfortable\, but 
 you never know what can happen in this game. I just went out there and l
 ocated my pitches\, got a lot of groundballs and battled.\n\n\"I felt go
 od pitching on three days' rest. I know\, later on\, I'm going to be rea
 lly tired\, because it has been a long time since I pitched on three day
 s' rest. But you know what? I took one for the team today\, and we ended
  up on a positive note.\"\n\nThe Mets had a chance to at least tie the s
 core in the seventh inning. They had the bases loaded and two outs\, but
  Joey Eischen struck out Cliff Floyd to end the inning. Eischen threw th
 ree breaking balls out of the strike zone\, and Floyd swung at all three
  pitches and missed.\n\n\"First pitch\, I just wanted to attack the stri
 ke zone\, but it kept breaking out of the zone\,\" said Eischen. \"After
  he went after that\, I took the next one further out. Once he swung at 
 that one\, he wasn't going to see a strike. He put the ball in my court\
 , and I was fortunate to win this battle.\"\n\nNew York made some more n
 oise in the ninth inning with closer Chad Cordero on the mound. Pinch-hi
 tter Jose Offerman led off with a walk. Jose Reyes then hit a perfect do
 uble-play ball to Cordero\, but Cordero bobbled the ball a couple of tim
 es\, and everybody was safe.\n\nCordero managed to get Miguel Cairo to p
 op up and Carlos Beltran to hit into a force play\, but Floyd hit a shar
 p ground ball that went between Johnson's legs\, allowing Offerman to sc
 ore.\n\n\"We don't make it easy\,\" said Robinson. \"Chad is giving up a
  leadoff walk\, and then panics on a ball hit right at him. He made two 
 mistakes on the fielding play -- rushing it and then trying to pick the 
 ball up with the glove. That's a no-no. You pick it up with your hand.\n
 \n\"Then you had the error by Nick. It was nervous stuff.\"\n\nDavid Wri
 ght came to the plate\, representing the tying run\, but Cordero struck 
 him out to end the game.\n\nThe Nationals went 7-6 on the 13-game road t
 rip and head back to Washington to play a three-game series against the 
 Reds. Robinson said that the Reds\, who are in fifth place in the NL Cen
 tral\, are a team the Nationals shouldn't take lightly. After all\, the 
 last time these two teams met\, the Reds swept the Nationals at Great Am
 erican Ball Park.\n\n\"They have some hitters on that ballclub that you 
 have to respect. They are not going to give it to you. You have to earn 
 it against them\,\" said Robinson.\n\n\nThis story was not subject to th

  seen more of Willis than of Carpenter\, and pointed out how much of an 
 easy time Willis has had with the Nationals/Expos during his career. Ent
 ering Tuesday's action\, Willis was 8-2 with a 2.48 ERA during his caree
 r and 3-0 with a 1.71 ERA this season.\n\nBut on Tuesday night\, however
 \, the Nationals were able to have their way with him\, and pounded the 
 Marlins\, 11-1\, in front of 11\,507 at Dolphins Stadium. It's the first
  time since May 7 that the Nationals scored more than 10 runs in a game 
 and only the fourth time they have accomplished that feat all year.\n\nW
 illis lasted four-plus innings and gave up nine runs -- five earned. The
  last time he gave up that many runs to the franchise was on May 20\, 20
 03\, when he gave up five runs in three innings against the Expos.\n\n\"
 We got some offense\,\" said Robinson. \"It would be good to go into the
  winter saying\, 'We got Dontrelle the last time he pitched against us.'
  Maybe it will be a carryover. Maybe this thing will turn around. Maybe 
 it will be our turn to win a few ballgames against him. It's nice to bea
 t him.\"\n\nJamey Carroll and Marlon Byrd were the hitting heroes. Carro
 ll went 2-for-5 with a career-high three RBIs\, and Byrd went 4-for-6 an
 d was a triple short of the cycle.\n\nThe Nationals' bullpen-by-committe
 e\, which featured Jon Rauch\, Mike Stanton\, Travis Hughes and John Hal
 ama\, allowed just the one run on nine hits. Stanton picked up the win\,
  and Willis lost his 10th game of the season.\n\nRauch\, making his firs
 t start since Aug. 13\, 2004\, had no idea that he would be on the hill 
 until he was riding the bus to Dolphins Stadium. He ended up pitching th
 ree shutout innings.\n\n\"I was surprised that I was starting\, since I 
 got up in the bullpen [on Monday]\,\" said Rauch\, who missed most of th
 e season because of shoulder problems. \"I threw 10 pitches in the bullp
 en\, but I didn't get into the game. It wasn't a stress on my arm\, by a
 ny means. I didn't think I would get the ball. At the same time\, you ar
 e pretty happy about it\, especially after you have missed so much time.
 \"\n\nFielding errors by the Marlins helped the Nationals score four run
 s in the second inning. With runners on first and third\, Rauch hit a sl
 ow roller down the third-base line. It looked as though it was going fou
 l but Willis touched it. Byrd scored on the play\, and Rauch collected a
 n infield single.\n\nBrad Wilkerson followed with a routine ground ball 
 that went through the legs of first baseman Carlos Delgado. Gary Bennett
  scored on the play\, and Rauch advanced to third.\n\nRauch then scored 
 on a Carroll single\, and Wilkerson scored the fourth run of the inning 
 when second baseman Mike Lowell made a throwing error on a ball hit by P
 reston Wilson.\n\n\"Willis wasn't as effective\, and they made mistakes 
 behind him\,\" said Carroll. \"We had to take advantage\, and we did a g
 ood job of doing that tonight. I think it forced him to change his game 
 a little bit.\"\n\nIn the third\, Byrd made it a 5-0 game when he drove 
 in Ryan Zimmerman with a double to left field.\n\nThe Nationals scored t
 hree more runs in the fifth inning\, which was highlighted by Carroll's 
 two-run double.\n\nIsmael Valdez was on the mound in the sixth inning wh
 en Wilkerson doubled home Guzman to make it a 10-0 game.\n\nByrd made it
  an 11-0 game with his solo homer off Paul Quantrill.\n\nSince returning
  from Triple-A New Orleans on Aug. 26\, Byrd is hitting .306 (19-for-62)
  with two home runs and nine RBIs. He is doing a good job of re-establis
 hing himself in the big leagues.\n\n\"When I went down to the Minors\, I
  had something to prove to myself and to this organization\,\" said Byrd
 . \"I did it in New Orleans\, and I had to show that I could hit big-lea
 gue pitching.\"\n\nThe Nationals improved their record to 80-78 and are 
 now tied with the Marlins for fourth place in the National League East. 
 The franchise is a win away from assuring a .500 record in three out of 
 the last four years.\n\n\nThis story was not subject to the approval of

DESCRIPTION:Win: 6-5\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nNEW YORK -- All year
  long\, Nationals manager Frank Robinson has said that in order for Vinn
 y Castilla to be successful as a hitter\, he must hit the ball to right 
 field.\nIt has been hard for Castilla to do just that because of a left 
 knee injury he suffered in Spring Training. The injury has caused Castil
 la to have one of his worst seasons in the big leagues.\n\n\"It's not ea
 sy\, man. If it was easy\, I would be hitting 1.000\,\" Castilla said. \
 "Hitting is the hardest thing in sports and I know when I was going well
 \, I was hitting the ball hard the other way. Plus\, I wasn't healthy al
 l year long. But I feel a little bit better. It started this month.\"\n\
 nOn Thursday afternoon\, Castilla's knee felt good enough to get a key b
 ase hit to right field in the top of the 10th inning\, helping the Natio
 nals defeat the Mets\, 6-5\, in front of 21\,441 fans at Shea Stadium to
  sweep the three-game series.\n\nThe Nationals are now 2 1/2 games behin
 d the Astros in the National League Wild Card race\, and Robinson is beg
 inning to catch playoff fever.\n\n\"This might be the victory that puts 
 us over the top before this thing is over\,\" Robinson said. \"It's a ga
 me we had [in the bank] and we almost let it get away. It didn't look li
 ke we were going to come back. In spite of ourselves\, we came back and 
 won it. It was a good team effort. Everybody got involved today and did 
 an outstanding job.\"\n\nAt first\, it looked like the 10th inning was g
 oing to be a disaster for the Nationals. With the score tied at 5 and no
  outs\, reliever Roberto Hernandez on the mound and Nick Johnson on firs
 t base\, Preston Wilson singled to right-center field. Johnson went all 
 the way to third base\, but Wilson was tagged out in a rundown between f
 irst and second.\n\nRobinson was very upset at Wilson. In the fact\, the
  TV cameras panned to Wilson and Robinson\, while Wilson explained the s
 ituation to his skipper.\n\n\"It was a bad read on my part\,\" Wilson sa
 id. \"I didn't realize that Gerald Williams was playing as deep as he wa
 s and he didn't come up throwing to third. He ended up throwing the ball
  into the middle of the field.\n\n\"My thought there was we got Nick on 
 first and he doesn't really run that well\, so I wanted to be aggressive
  and I wanted the middle infielders to cut the ball off so he would get 
 to third. Johnson made it to third easier than I thought.\"\n\nRobinson 
 didn't buy Wilson's explanation. The mental mistake spoiled a great game
  for Wilson\, who went 4-for-5 with two RBIs.\n\n\"I don't buy excuses v
 ery easily. There are certain things that you expect from your players\,
  basic things in this game that you are supposed to do. He didn't do tha
 t today\,\" Robinson said of Wilson.\n\nAfter Ryan Church grounded out f
 or the second out of the inning\, Castilla took Hernandez's first pitch 
 and drove it to right field to score Johnson and break the 5-5 tie.\n\n\
 "I was just aggressive in that situation. I tried to get a good pitch to
  hit and hit hard somewhere. He threw me a fastball at the outside corne
 r and I went to right field\,\" Castilla said.\n\nIn a surprise twist\, 
 Robinson brought in Gary Majewski to close the game instead of bullpen a
 ce Chad Cordero. Robinson felt that Cordero's arm was tired. The skipper
  noticed that in his last three outings\, Cordero's fastball was clocked
  in the 80s instead of the low 90s.\n\nMajewski\, who was informed befor
 e the game that he would be the closer\, gave up a leadoff single to Wil
 liams\, but retired the next three hitters to pick up his first career s
 ave.\n\n\"In Spring Training\, you are always preparing yourself to go t
 o the playoffs\, and nobody expected us to do as well as we have this ye
 ar\,\" Majewski said. \"It's great for the fans and ourselves. We want t
 o win and they want to win. It's awesome this late in the season to swee
 p a team on their home field.\"\n\nThe winning pitcher was Jason Bergman
 n\, while Roberto Hernandez took the loss.\n\nIn the early going\, the N
 ationals gave starter Livan Hernandez a 3-0 lead in the first inning off
  Mets starter Jae Seo. Wilson drove in two runs with a single to right\,
  while Castilla drove in the third run of the game with a sacrifice fly 
 that scored Wilson.\n\nThe Mets made it a two-run game in the bottom of 
 the inning\, when Jose Reyes took Livan Hernandez's 1-0 pitch and hit th
 e ball over the right-field fence.\n\nThe Nationals made it a 4-1 game w
 hen Cristian Guzman homered over the right-center-field fence off Seo.\n
 \nBut the Mets took the lead in the bottom of the fifth inning. The Mets
  had the bases loaded with two outs\, when Cliff Floyd took a 3-2 pitch 
 and hit a line drive over the right-field wall for his fifth career gran
 d slam that gave the Mets a 5-4 lead.\n\nLivan Hernandez ended up pitchi
 ng six-plus innings and gave up five runs on nine hits. He struck out on
 e batter and walked another.\n\nThe Nationals were able to tie the score
  off Braden Looper in the top of the ninth\, and it was rookie Ryan Zimm
 erman\, who started things off by hitting a single to right field. The b
 all took a weird bounce and went past Williams for an error\, which allo
 wed Zimmerman to get to second base.\n\nAfter Guzman grounded out to put
  pinch-runner Kenny Kelly on third base\, pinch-hitter Jose Guillen was 
 hit by a pitch.\n\nWith the infield in\, Brad Wilkerson hit a 3-2 pitch 
 right at second baseman Kaz Matsui. But the ball went under Matsui's glo
 ve and Kelly scored on the play to tie the score at 5.\n\n\"With the cou
 nt 3-2 and the runners running\, it's going to be tough to turn two. Tha
 t's one of the reasons I think they were in\,\" Wilkerson said. \"I knew
  the runner [at first] was going. I was trying to put the ball on the gr
 ound. I tried to get on top of the ball and I did that.\"\n\nThis story

 NGTON -- With President George W. Bush and Secretary of State Condoleezz
 a Rice in attendance\, right-hander Esteban Loaiza pitched six solid inn
 ings\, drove in two runs and helped the Nationals blank the Blue Jays\, 
 3-0\, in front of 36\,689 at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium on Friday night.\
 nLoaiza (3-5) had missed a turn in the rotation last Sunday because of a
  stiff neck and back of the shoulder. He was still in some pain on Frida
 y\, but one would have never realized by the way he was pitching. Loaiza
  gave up only six hits\, while striking out five batters and walking one
 .\n\n\"I still have a little bit of pain\,\" Loaiza said. \"I wanted to 
 go out there and not overthrow. But everything turned out well and now I
  have to wait for my next outing.\"\n\nThe only sign of trouble occurred
  in the top of the sixth inning. The Blue Jays had runners on first and 
 second and no outs\, but Aaron Hill popped out to second baseman Junior 
 Spivey\, Vernon Wells struck out looking and Eric Hinske grounded out to
  second base to end the inning.\n\n\"[With two runners on base]\, you do
 n't know if they are bunting or not. You know it's an American League te
 am\,\" catcher Brian Schneider said. \"Getting that first out was big be
 cause it put us in a double-play situation. And we went from there. We g
 ot the outs when we needed it.\"\n\nLoaiza helped himself with the bat a
 gainst Blue Jays starter Josh Towers in the second inning. With runners 
 on first and second and two outs\, Loaiza took the first pitch and doubl
 ed down the left-field line to score Vinny Castilla and Spivey.\n\nThe l
 ast time Loaiza drove in a run was back on July 2\, 1998\, against the T
 igers. Loaiza was a member of the Pirates at the time.\n\n\"It's has bee
 n a long time since I drove in a run\,\" Loaiza said. \"[Towers] threw a
  slider over the plate. I was going to take the pitch\, but after lookin
 g at the outfielders\, I figured he was going to come up with a first-pi
 tch strike\, and I just wanted to make contact.\"\n\nThe two-run double 
 was ironic because the Nationals have had problems scoring for Loaiza. T
 hey are averaging 2.55 runs for Loaiza\, the fourth lowest in the Major 
 Leagues this season. Manager Frank Robinson believes the game would have
  been much tighter if Loaiza didn't drive in those runs.\n\n\"If he didn
 't get the hit\, that would been a real battle out there\,\" Robinson sa
 id. \"Esteban swings the bat decently. He can put the bat on the ball on
  certain pitches. But that was a typical game. We don't score when he's 
 out there.\"\n\nBrad Wilkerson added to the lead in the bottom of the se
 venth inning when he hit a solo home run over the right-field wall again
 st Justin Speier. It was Wilkerson's fifth home run of the season\n\n\"I
  made a couple of weak swings with two strikes\,\" Wilkerson said. \"He 
 made a pretty good pitch on me. It's not a pitch that you usually drive 
 out. I hit it right in the screws and it felt really good off the bat.\"
 \n\nGary Majewski\, Luis Ayala and Chad Cordero shut out the Blue Jays t
 he rest of the way with Cordero picking up his 24th save.\n\nBy winning 
 the game\, it meant that Loaiza moved past Ismael Valdez for second plac
 e in wins for Mexican-born pitchers with 103. Loaiza now trails Fernando
  Valenzuela\, who has 173 victories.\n\nLoaiza had no idea about his mos
 t recent accomplishment until a reporter gave him the news.\n\n\"It give
 s me goose bumps. It's special. Now I have to get more wins and see how 
 far I could go in my career\,\" Loaiza said. \"I never thought I would b
 e in the big leagues or be where I'm at right now. I want to go out ther
 e and play.\"\n\nThe Nationals have now won 11 consecutive games at home
  and improved their home record to 25-9. Overall\, the Nationals are 43-
 30 and in first place in the National League East\, four games ahead of 
 the Braves.\n\n\"We just feel good coming home off the road and playing 
 before the fans [at RFK Stadium]. We feel very comfortable here and we a
 re having very good success\,\" Robinson said.\n\nThis story was not sub

 er was Jason Christiansen.\n\nThe game seesawed back and fourth and had 
 its share of controversy. The Nationals gave starter Esteban Loaiza the

DESCRIPTION:InterLeauge\n\nWin: 9-2\n\nBy Bob Matuszak / Special to MLB.
 com\n\nTORONTO -- Manager Frank Robinson has been searching everywhere f
 or that elusive big inning. Jose Guillen was more than happy to find it 
 for his skipper.\nTony Blanco hit his first career home run\, and Guille
 n capped a five-run fifth inning with a three-run double to help give Wa
 shington a 9-2 win over Toronto on Sunday afternoon.\n\n\"We finally got
  some runs\,\" Guillen said. \"It was one of those days where we felt li
 ke we had to come up and do it.\"\n\nThe Nationals used a rediscovered o
 ffensive attack\, along with a solid outing by starter Tomo Ohka (3-3)\,
  to snap a two-game losing streak and avoid a sweep in their first visit
  to Canada since leaving Montreal after last season.\n\n\"We showed we c
 an win\, and we showed we can win in another country\,\" joked Robinson.
  \"After they scored two and we responded with five\, that was nice. It'
 s good for the morale of the team\, because we were just sitting around 
 to see what was going to happen. Overall\, it was a great win\, and ever
 yone contributed.\"\n\nAfter being handcuffed in the first two games of 
 the series by Toronto starters Ted Lilly and Roy Halladay\, things looke
 d bleak against Josh Towers\, who entered the game having won four strai
 ght games\, the longest streak by a Blue Jays pitcher this season.\n\nTh
 rough the first four innings\, Towers shut down the Washington bats\, al
 lowing just a second-inning double to Ryan Church and a single by Marlon
  Byrd\, both with two out.\n\nBut the Nationals were able to get to Towe
 rs in the game-breaking fifth with four consecutive singles to start the
  frame. Then\, with one out and two already in\, Guillen launched a line
 r over the head of center fielder Vernon Wells\, scoring Gary Bennett\, 
 Christian Guzman and Jamey Carroll.\n\n\"We all have to contribute\, som
 ehow\, some way\,\" Guillen said. \"We came up with the clutch hits and 
 Blanco came up with the big homer. We win as a team and we lose as a tea
 m.\"\n\nWashington increased its lead to 8-2 when Blanco crushed relieve
 r Vinnie Chulk's 1-1 pitch to straightaway center field in the seventh i
 nning\, Washington's first three-run homer this season.\n\nBlanco was in
 serted into the game in the third inning when Vinny Castilla had to leav
 e with a sore left knee\, and moved to left field when Jeffrey Hammonds 
 was lifted after the top half of the fifth inning with a pulled right ha
 mstring.\n\n\"My first at-bat\, I wasn't really comfortable\,\" said Bla
 nco\, who flew out and grounded out before his bomb in the seventh. \"Bu
 t then I found myself.\"\n\nBlanco is used to hitting the long ball\, ha
 ving connected for 29 home runs in the Minors last season.\n\n\"The guys
  were saying 'When are you going to hit a home run? You're a big guy\,'\
 " said the 6-foot-1 Blanco. \"I feel great.\"\n\nBlanco also got an adde
 d bonus\, as Guillen will purchase diamond earrings for the rookie and C
 astilla will supply a watch. The three made bets that Blanco would hit a
  home run in his first 50 big-league at-bats.\n\nHome run No. 1 came in 
 at-bat No. 22\, after Nick Johnson was intentionally walked to put runne
 rs at first and second with one out. While in the on-deck circle\, Blanc
 o didn't waste much time plotting out his strategy against Chulk.\n\n\"I
  was thinking to get a good pitch and to hit it hard somewhere\,\" Blanc
 o said. \"I'm a rookie\, and they think I can't hit the ball. So I just 
 wanted to hit it hard somewhere.\"\n\nTowers (5-2) lost for the first ti
 me in three career decisions against the Nationals\, giving up five runs
  on seven hits in 4 1/3 innings.\n\nWhat makes the win especially impres
 sive is that the Nationals did all of the offensive damage without cente
 r fielder Brad Wilkerson\, who is being bothered by a troublesome right 
 forearm. Though Wilkerson is listed as day-to-day\, he may miss more tha
 n just a couple of games because of the injury.\n\nWilkerson is expected
  to get a bone scan in Cincinnati when the team begins a three-game seri
 es with the Reds Monday.\n\nOhka\, meanwhile\, gave his team exactly wha
 t they were searching for after two consecutive lackluster outings by th
 eir starters\, allowing just two runs on five hits in eight innings.\n\n
 \"I tried to keep the ball down today\,\" said Ohka\, who got the start 
 in place of the injured John Patterson.\n\nIt was the first start in Tor
 onto since Ohka had his no-hit bid broken up with two outs in the sevent
 h by former Blue Jays first baseman Carlos Delgado in June 2003.\n\n\"No
 thing special\,\" Ohka reasoned about his success at Rogers Centre.\n\nW
 hat was special was Ohka's control in his 102-pitch performance. Ohka on
 ly walked one batter after coming into the game averaging five walks per
  nine innings.\n\n\"He threw strikes and made the hitters swing the bat\
 ,\" Robinson said. \"You have to get ahead of the hitters\, and he did. 
 You saw what happened when he got behind to [Shea] Hillenbrand. Boom. Se
 e you later.\"\n\nToronto grabbed a 2-0 lead in the fourth when Hillenbr
 and deposited an Ohka pitch into the left-field stands. It was to be the
  only mistake the righty made on a day in which he may have pitched hims
 elf back into the starting rotation. But then again...\n\n\"Let's not ju
 mp to conclusions\,\" Robinson said.\n\nNot yet\, anyway.\n\nThis story

DESCRIPTION:Loss: 4-5\n\nBy Andy Jasner / MLB.com\n\nPHILADELPHIA -- Nat
 ionals manager Frank Robinson says his team never does anything easy\, a
 nd that was quite evident on Sunday afternoon.\nThe Nationals watched a 
 4-2 lead dissipate in the eighth inning and lost\, 5-4\, to the Phillies
  in 12 innings before 34\,124 at Citizens Bank Park.\nPinch-hitter Ramon
  Martinez came to the plate with a .154 average (2-for-13 this season) a
 nd hit a bases-loaded single to left in the 12th off Sun-Woo Kim\, scori
 ng David Bell with the winning run.\n\"I wanted a ground ball\,\" Kim sa
 id. \"He hit it through.\" Jose Guillen hit a two-run homer and Jose Vid
 ro contributed three hits for the Nationals\, who lost their second stra
 ight game to the Phillies. Washington still heads into the All-Star brea
 k in first place in the National League East.\n\n\"It's tough\,\" Robins
 on said. \"Yesterday was tough also. It got away from us. That's just th
 e way it goes.\"\n\nIt was going well for the Nationals as Guillen's bla
 st to left field in the fourth inning\, his 18th of the season\, gave th
 e Nationals a 3-0 lead.\n\nBoth managers were involved in a bizarre sequ
 ence during Guillen's next at-bat in the sixth. Guillen fouled a ball of
 f his ankle and needed some extra time to regain his composure. While Ro
 binson was checking on Guillen\, Phillies manager Charlie Manuel walked 
 toward home plate.\n\nRobinson said he had words with Manuel before the 
 umpires came in to settle down both benches.\n\n\"I did have a little di
 scussion with him\,\" Robinson said. \"Charlie started hollering at the 
 umpire\, 'Get him back in the box. Get him back in the box.' All I said 
 to him was\, 'Hey\, the guy is hurt. What do you want?' I said it twice 
 because he kept hollering at the umpire. I said\, 'Charlie\, the guy is 
 hurt. What do you want him to do?'\"\n\nAfter the Phillies closed within
  3-2\, the Nationals received an insurance run in the seventh. With two 
 out\, Jamey Carroll and Vidro hit back-to-back singles to put runners at
  first and third.\n\nPhillies relief pitcher Ryan Madson threw a wild pi
 tch with Guillen at the plate\, allowing Carroll to score for a 4-2 lead
 .\n\nEsteban Loaiza pitched six solid innings and gave up six hits and t
 wo earned runs.\n\nPhillies first baseman Ryan Howard tied the game at 4
  with a two-run blast to center field in the eighth.\n\nBut the National
 s could never break through with the winning run. They left 12 runners o
 n base and were just 2- for-10 with runners in scoring position.\n\n\"It
 's a tough way to end the first half\,\" said Nationals closer Chad Cord
 ero\, who pitched 1 1/3 shutout innings and lowered his ERA to 1.13. \"W
 e have to forget about it and move on.\"\n\nCordero and Livan Hernandez 
 will move on to the All-Star Game in Detroit\, while the rest of the tea
 m will be off until Thursday's game at Milwaukee. The players definitely
  need the rest\, with many of them banged up.\n\nAside from Guillen foul
 ing a ball off his ankle\, catcher Brian Schneider left the game in the 
 sixth after experiencing a dizzy spell.\n\n\"I'm alright\, just a little
  sick\,\" said Schneider. \"I've got a sore throat. Everything's just cl
 ogged up right now.\"\n\nAny manager could be a little upset after a dis
 couraging loss like this.\n\nNot Robinson.\n\"I'm very proud of the ball

SUMMARY:(L) vs Giants
DESCRIPTION:Loss: 1-5\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- Right
 -hander John Patterson said he felt physically strong on Wednesday\, bet
 ter\, in fact\, than he'd felt in weeks. But the results of his start We
 dnesday didn't measure up as the Giants defeated the Nationals\, 5-1\, i
 n front of 32\,076 at RFK Stadium on Wednesday night.\nThe Nationals hav
 e now lost four consecutive games and are six games behind the Astros in
  the National League Wild Card race. With the losses mounting\, the Nati
 onals could be eliminated from the playoff picture by this weekend.\n\n\
 "Any losses that we have are disappointing\,\" manager Frank Robinson sa
 id. \"After last night's game\, we came out tonight and were almost shut
  out. It's disappointing.\"\n\nPatterson pitched seven innings and gave 
 up five runs on 10 hits. He struck out nine batters and walked two.\n\nA
 t first\, it appeared that Patterson didn't take heed to what Livan Hern
 andez was doing to Barry Bonds the previous night. Hernandez threw an in
 side pitch -- a fastball -- to Bonds\, who muscled the ball into the upp
 er deck in right field. From that point on\, Hernandez threw nothing but
  outside pitches the rest of the way\, and Bonds didn't do any further d
 amage\n\nHow did Patterson approach Bonds on Wednesday? He threw an insi
 de pitch -- a cut fastball -- to Bonds\, who hit the ball over the right
 -field fence for a two-run home run to give the Giants a 2-0 lead. Bonds
  has now homered in four consecutive games.\n\n\"It was good pitch\,\" P
 atterson said. \"I put the cutter in on him. It was going to be a ball -
 - down and in. I don't know how he hit it. We were all talking about it 
 after we came into the dugout. If he was going to beat me [next time]\, 
 he was going to have to beat me the other way.\n\n\"If I had to throw th
 at pitch again\, I would throw it. I don't question that pitch. I don't 
 question a lot if pitches I threw tonight. It's the best I've felt in a 
 month. I really felt good tonight. A lot didn't go my way tonight.\"\n\n
 Patterson did strike out Bonds the next two times they faced\, but other
  members of the Giants did damage against Patterson and the Nationals.\n
 \nGiants right-hander Brad Hennessey did the job on the mound\, but he w
 ould have to deal with a minor problem in the second inning.\n\nThe Nati
 onals cut the lead in half when Cristian Guzman beat out an infield sing
 le to score Vinny Castilla.\n\nHennessey would blank the Nationals the n
 ext 5 2/3 innings. He gave up just one run on three hits\, striking out 
 three batters and walking one.\n\n\"All we do is swing the bat\,\" Robin
 son said. \"We had zero production from our [Nos. 1 through 5] hitters\,
  and you are not going to win too many ballgames [like that].\"\n\nHenne
 ssey also helped himself with the bat. He went 2-for-3 against Patterson
  and hit his second home run of the season.\n\nRobinson was not pleased 
 that Patterson threw only fastballs to Hennessey. The skipper believes h
 is hurlers should challenge opposing pitchers with breaking balls.\n\nIn
  the fifth inning\, Hennessey led off with a double and later scored on 
 a Randy Winn single to give the Giants a 4-1 lead.\n\nTwo innings later\
 , Hennessey homered over the left-field wall on the first pitch he saw f
 rom Patterson.\n\n\"Frank doesn't like us throwing fastballs to pitchers
 \,\" Patterson said. \"I struck [Hennessey] out on a fastball in his fir
 st at-bat. I went back to the fastball in the second at-bat and he got a
  base hit. I took it for granted that he was going to take the first pit
 ch [in the second at-bat] and he didn't. It was his night on the mound a
 nd at the plate.\"\n\nThis story was not subject to the approval of Majo

 nio Alfonseca on the mound and two outs\, Guillen belted an 0-2 pitch ov
 er the center-field wall for his second homer of the season.\n\nThe winn
 ing pitcher was closer Chad Cordero\, who pitched two innings and gave u
 p the game-tying home run to Carlos Delgado in the bottom of the ninth.\
 n\nRight-hander Livan Hernandez\, who didn't figure in the decision\, wa
 s the antithesis of his last start in which he gave up seven runs in 4 2
 /3 innings against the Phillies last Monday. He gave up just one run in 
 seven solid innings. He allowed five hits\, struck out four and walked o
 ne. Hernandez threw 116 pitches\, 72 for strikes.\n\nThe Marlins cut the
  Nationals' lead to 2-1 in the fifth. With runners on first and second a
 nd one out\, Delgado hit a sharp ground ball to first baseman Nick Johns
 on\, who threw the ball to shortstop Cristian Guzman for the force out a
 t second base. But Guzman threw the ball away\, which allowed Juan Encar
 nacion to score.\n\nRight-hander Brian Moehler was Hernandez's counterpa

 ed in the next inning. Ryan Church\, who missed three of the last four g
 ames because of tightness in his right groin\, took Moehler's 1-0 pitch 
 and hit the ball over the right-field wall for his first home run of the
  season.\n\nVinny Castilla followed with a blast over the left-center fi
 eld wall to give the Nationals a 2-0 lead.\n\nMoehler pitched 4 2/3 inni

DESCRIPTION:Loss: 3-5\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nCINCINNATI -- Reds 
 left-hander Eric Milton pitched eight solid innings and also contributed
  with the bat as the Nationals fell to Cincinnati\, 5-3\, in front of 17
 \,630 at Great American Ball Park on Monday night.\nThe loss spoiled the
  return of Nationals interim general manager Jim Bowden\, who was the GM
  of the Reds from 1992-2003.\n\nMilton was the second opposing starter i
 n four days to go into a game with an ERA over 7.00 and baffle the Natio
 nals. On Friday\, Blue Jays starter Ted Lilly had an ERA over 10.00 befo
 re pitching six solid innings to notch the win.\n\nOn Monday\, Milton ga
 ve up three runs (one earned) on six hits. All three runs were scored on
  home runs -- a solo homer by Nick Johnson and a two-run shot by pinch-h
 itter Brendan Harris. The two-run shot was unearned because Cristian Guz
 man reached base on an error by shortstop Felipe Lopez.\n\nMilton struck
  out seven and walked two. He also went 2-for-3 at the plate with an RBI
  and a run scored.\n\nFollowing the homers\, the Nationals had a chance 
 to do some more damage in the eighth inning. They had runners at first a
 nd second with two out and Tony Blanco representing the go-ahead run\, b
 ut Blanco struck out looking to end the frame.\n\n\"We couldn't do much 
 offensively\, and we couldn't do much to stop the Reds offensively\,\" m
 anager Frank Robinson said. \"I felt good about our chances [in the eigh
 th inning]\, but I didn't feel good the way it ended.\"\n\nNationals cen
 ter fielder Marlon Byrd played with Milton when they both were with the 
 Phillies\, and Byrd said the left-hander normally throws fastballs and c
 utters. But Milton threw a lot of breaking balls for strikes.\n\n\"He th
 rows hard\, especially with two strikes. He really didn't do that tonigh
 t. He got ahead with breaking balls\,\" Byrd said.\n\nOutfielder Jose Gu
 illen was upset at his 0-for-4 night that included three strikeouts\, co
 mmenting that Robinson should place him near the bottom of the lineup.\n
 \n\"The way I'm swinging\, I'm just sick [to my stomach]\,\" Guillen sai
 d. \"I don't think I should be hitting third. I should be hitting ninth 
 behind the pitcher. I'm not performing the way I should be. I hope Frank
  puts me seventh or eighth.\"\n\nNationals right-hander Esteban Loaiza h
 ad his worst outing of the season\, giving up all five runs in five inni
 ngs. He also allowed a career-high 11 hits.\n\n\"I felt good. I had my v
 elocity\, cutter and changeup\, but I left a lot of pitches right over t
 he plate and they made contact\,\" Loaiza said. \"They collected hits\, 
 and we ended up with the loss.\"\n\nIn the second inning\, Milton drove 
 in the first run of the game off Loaiza by hitting a single to left fiel
 d to score Austin Kearns.\n\n\"Milton just put the ball in play\, and I 
 think that's what really cost me the game\,\" Loaiza said.\n\nKen Griffe

 ean Casey with an infield single.\n\nLopez made it 4-0 in the fourth inn
 ing by hitting a sacrifice fly to left field\, scoring Milton\, and LaRu
 e hit a solo home run in the fifth to make it 5-0.\n\nAsked if he felt p
 ressured to be perfect considering that the Nationals have had trouble s
 coring runs for him\, Loaiza said\, \"No. I just want to pitch my game. 
 You can't always be perfect\, but I just went out there and threw my pit

DESCRIPTION:Loss: 2-4\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nMILWAUKEE -- After 
 the Nationals lost five of their last seven games before the All-Star br
 eak\, manager Frank Robinson was concerned about the team's offense. The
  Nationals averaged 3.14 runs per game during that span\, and it reminde
 d Robinson how lethargic the team looked early in the season.\nRobinson 
 was hoping the All-Star break would energize the offense\, but it didn't
  on Thursday afternoon as the Nationals lost to the Brewers\, 4-2\, in f
 ront of 30\,611 at Miller Park.\n\nBrewers left-hander Doug Davis pitche
 d seven solid innings and gave up two runs on four hits. He tied a caree
 r high with nine strikeouts and walked two batters. Matt Wise and Derric
 k Turnbow shut out the Nationals the rest of way without giving up a run
 .\n\n\"The lack of hitting has been going on for about a week\,\" Robins
 on said. \"We are not doing anything offensively. Our bats are missing i
 n action to tell you the truth. And when we get a few opportunities\, we
  are not cashing in.\n\n\"I was aware of the struggles before the break\
 , but I felt that maybe we were a little tired -- looking forward to the
  break. Hopefully\, we would comeback with a lot of energy and pick up w
 here we left off when we were playing good baseball. We are looking like
  we did going into the break.\"\n\nSecond baseman Jose Vidro is baffled 
 as to why the Nationals continue to be overmatched by the likes of Davis
  and Phillies right-hander Corey Lidle\, pitchers who are known to chang
 e speeds rather throw blazing fastballs.\n\n\"We are just a very aggress
 ive club that thinks about the hard-throwing fastball\,\" Vidro said. \"
 [Pitchers who change speeds] have our number. But we have to make adjust
 ments.\"\n\nIt was another no-decision for Nationals right-hander John P
 atterson\, who pitched six solid innings and gave up two runs on seven h
 its. He struck out a career-high nine batters and walked one. Patterson 
 now has 11 no-decisions\, and the last time he won a game was on June 10
  against the Mariners.\n\nPatterson admitted that it was getting frustra
 ting not to pick up victories.\n\n\"This game is judged by wins and I ha
 ve five decisions in 16 starts. That can wear on you a little\,\" Patter
 son said. \"I'm throwing the ball good. Coming into this season\, my pla
 n was to do exactly what I'm doing right now. I'm succeeding as far as t
 hat goes.\"\n\nPatterson may have had good numbers on Thursday\, but Rob
 inson dwelled on the fact that Patterson threw too many pitches in six i
 nnings. In total\, Patterson threw 115 pitches\, including 99 after five
  innings.\n\nIt's not just Patterson that is throwing a high number of p
 itches -- the entire starting staff is\,\" Robinson said. \"You look up 
 and we are in the fifth inning and they are close to 100 pitches. What y
 ou can expect from them is that they can pitch five or six innings.\"\n\
 nPatterson acknowledged that the hitters are having too many three-ball 
 counts.\n\n\"I need to cut down on that a little bit and try to go into 
 the eighth inning\,\" Patterson said.\n\nPatterson was given a 1-0 lead 
 in the second inning\, when Preston Wilson\, making his Nationals debut\
 , took Doug Davis' 3-1 pitch and hit the ball over the left-field wall f
 or his first home run in a Nationals uniform.\n\n\"The Nationals already
  know that I can hit a home run. Hopefully\, I can fit in to what they a
 re trying to do here on a daily basis\,\" Wilson said.\n\nBut the Brewer
 s tied things up in the bottom of the inning off Patterson as Damian Mil
 ler hit a sacrifice fly to drive in Bill Hall.\n\nVidro untied it for th
 e Nationals in the top of the third inning against Davis. With runners o
 n second and third and one out\, Vidro grounded out to Hall at shortstop
 \, but Brad Wilkerson scored on the play.\n\nBut Patterson couldn't hold
  on to the lead as Jenkins took an inside fastball and homered over the 
 right-field wall to tie the score at 2 in the sixth.\n\nIn the bottom of
  the eighth inning\, with reliever Gary Majewski on the mound\, the Brew
 ers had runners on first and second and one out when Miller broke a 2-2 
 tie with a double to left-center field to drive in Jenkins and Russell B
 ranyan.\n\n\"I got behind in the count. I had to throw the ball over the

 ki said. \"Things haven't been going my way as of late. I just have to w
 ork harder\, keep the ball down and keep doing what I can.\"\n\nThe winn
 ing pitcher was Wise\, while Majewski took the loss. Turnbow picked up h
 is 18th save of the season.\n\nThe Nationals have lost three consecutive
  games and dropped their record to 52-37. The last time the Nationals lo
 st that many games in a row was from May 23-28\, when they lost five in

SUMMARY:(W) vs Rockies
DESCRIPTION:Win: 4-0\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- After 
 getting Cory Sullivan to pop up to first baseman Brad Wilkerson to end t
 he top of the eighth inning of Tuesday night's 4-0 victory over the Rock
 ies\, Nationals right-hander John Patterson walked toward the dugout and
  shook his head while looking at manager Frank Robinson and pitching coa
 ch Randy St. Claire.\nIt was Patterson's way of telling Robinson and St.
  Claire that he was going to pitch the ninth inning. Robinson and St. Cl
 aire\, however\, already had their minds made up that he was out of the 
 game.\n\n\"I just communicated to them that I wanted the ninth inning\,\
 " Patterson said. \"I went to the dugout and they pulled me out of the g
 ame. They said if we score two runs in the bottom of the [eighth inning]
 \, I can pitch the ninth.\"\n\nThe Nationals scored two more runs and ha
 d a four-run lead. Robinson then decided to let Patterson pitch the fina
 l frame.\n\n\"I actually shut it down\, and then we scored and I said\, 
 'Oh my God\, we scored.' I picked it back up again\,\" Patterson said.\n
 \nPatterson ended up leaving the game after giving up a leadoff single t
 o Aaron Miles. But the hit couldn't put a damper on the hurler's perform
 ance. He pitched eight shutout innings\, surrending three hits\, in fron
 t of 30\,655 at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium.\n\nPatterson (4-2) struck out
  eight and walked two\, relying mostly on his fastball. His right hand w
 as so moist that he had a tough time throwing the curveball\, so he stop
 ped throwing it after a couple of innings.\n\n\"I threw a lot of fastbal
 ls in the zone\, tried to keep the ball down and get some groundballs. I
  just worked my fastball in and out\,\" Patterson said.\n\nIt was Patter
 son's first victory since June 11 against the Mariners. Since then\, he 
 was 0-1 with five consecutive no-decisions.\n\n\"We knew he was on top o
 f his game tonight the way he started out -- throwing strikes and gettin
 g ahead of the hitters\,\" Robinson said.\n\nAfter his last start agains
 t the Brewers\, Patterson admitted that having just five decisions in 16
  starts was wearing on him a little bit. But on Tuesday\, Patterson was 
 just thinking about the Nationals\, who desperately needed a victory to 
 remain in first place in the National League East. Entering Tuesday's ac
 tion\, the Nationals were only one-half game ahead of the Braves and had
  lost nine of their last 12 games.\n\nPatterson admitted that he felt th
 e pressure.\n\n\"Honestly\, I didn't come into this game thinking about 
 getting a win for me. We needed it as a team\,\" Patterson said. \"Early
  in the game\, I was trying to conserve some pitches so I [could] go dee
 per in the game. It worked out today.\n\n\"My focus was getting a win to
 night -- plain and simple. That's all I wanted to do.\"\n\nThe only time
  Patterson was in serious trouble was in the fifth inning.\n\nThe Rockie
 s had the bases loaded with two out\, but Patterson managed to strike ou
 t Sullivan to end the inning.\n\nBecause of their lack of offense in rec
 ent weeks\, Robinson tweaked the lineup by benching shortstop Cristian G
 uzman\, who has been in a season-long slump\, and sitting down third bas
 eman Vinny Castilla\, who has been hampered by a left knee injury.\n\nJa
 mey Carroll and Carlos Baerga ended up replacing Guzman and Castilla\, r
 espectively\, and the move worked as the Nationals gave Patterson all he
  needed by scoring two runs off Rockies right-hander Shawn Chacon (1-6) 
 in the second.\n\nWith nobody out\, Preston Wilson scored all the way fr
 om first base on a double by Ryan Church. Two outs later\, Church came i
 n to score on a single to left-center field by Carroll.\n\n\"The only wa
 y you are going to score runs is by putting men on base. We have to put 
 a lot of people out there to score because we miss a lot of opportunitie
 s\,\" Robinson said.\n\nThe Nationals added to their lead in the bottom 
 of the eighth inning off former teammate Zach Day. With runners on first
  and third and nobody out\, Brian Schneider singled to right-center fiel
 d to score Wilkerson.\n\nWilson followed with a single to left to score 
 Jose Guillen.\n\nIt was Day's first appearance against the Nationals sin
 ce they traded him to the Rockies for Wilson last Wednesday. Like his ti
 me with the Nationals this season\, Day's sinker had trouble finding its
  spots.\n\n\"All my pitches were up in the strike zone\,\" Day said. \"I

DESCRIPTION:Win: 5-3\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nMILWAUKEE -- The way
  Nationals outfielder Jose Guillen sees it\, he should not be playing in
  the four-game series against the Brewers.\nHe said he should have trave
 led to Washington\, D.C.\, to get his painful left shoulder\, left ankle
  and rib cage checked out. In fact\, Guillen said he was supposed to get
  a cortisone shot once he reached the nation's capital.\n\nBut Guillen g
 utted it out in Milwaukee and went 0-for-9 in the first two games of the
  series against the Brewers. But\, on Saturday\, Guillen came up big in 
 the seventh inning and helped the Nationals defeat the Brewers\, 5-3\, i
 n front of 45\,079 at Miller Park.\n\n\"The only reason I care about thi
 s team is because I really want to win. The type of attitude that we hav
 e here gives me the motivation to play\,\" Guillen said.\n\nThe score wa
 s tied at 3\, when Guillen broke the stalemate in the seventh. With runn
 ers on second and third\, two outs and reliever Ricky Bottalico on the m
 ound\, Guillen took a hanging slider and singled up the middle to drive 
 in Carlos Baerga and Ryan Church.\n\nGuillen even made a great catch off
  the bat of Chris Magruder to end the game.\n\n\"Jose is beat up\,\" man
 ager Frank Robinson said. \"I think the only thing that is not swollen i
 s his head. I'm amazed that he could go out there and perform. Defensive
 ly\, you wouldn't even know that he's hurting the way he has to kick it 
 in.\"\n\nRobinson said he was surprised the Brewers didn't walk Guillen 
 to load the bases for a possible force out in the seventh inning. Once t
 he Brewers decided to pitch to Guillen\, Robinson was confident that his
  best slugger would come through even though he was in a mini-slump.\n\n
 \"I was glad they didn't walk him because I feel this guy is going to ri
 se to the occasion. And he does it more often than not\,\" Robinson said
 .\n\nThe winning pitcher was Esteban Loaiza (6-5)\, who has now won four
  straight decisions. He pitched six innings and gave up three runs on se
 ven hits. Loaiza struck out four batters and walked one.\n\nGary Majewsk
 i\, Mike Stanton and Chad Cordero shut out the Brewers the rest of the w
 ay\, as Cordero picked up his 32nd save.\n\n\"It feels good to be over .
 500\,\" Loaiza said. \"There's nothing much I could do today and I got t
 he win. My teammates supported me with some more runs.\"\n\nLoaiza's cou
 nterpart\, Chris Capuano\, was not the same pitcher who baffled the Nati
 onals in Washington on May 18. On Saturday\, Capuano pitched six innings
  and gave up three runs on five hits.\n\nThe Nationals jumped to a 1-0 l
 ead in the second inning off Capuano. With one out\, Vinny Castilla drov
 e in Preston Wilson with a double to center field.\n\nBut the Brewers to
 ok the lead in the bottom of the inning. Damian Miller drove in Geoff Je
 nkins with a single\, and Miller scored all the way from first base on a
  double by J.J. Hardy.\n\nThe Nationals tied the score in the fourth as 
 Castilla again drove in Wilson with a double\, and pulled ahead\, 3-2\, 
 in the sixth on Jose Vidro's fifth home run of the season. It's was Vidr
 o's first home run since April 20 against the Braves.\n\n\"When I looked
  at the replay\, it looked like they were trying to go in and they misse
 d a pitch\,\" Vidro said. \"It was a fastball outside.\"\n\nHowever\, th
 e Brewers came back in the bottom of the sixth as catcher Gary Bennett p
 ulled off his best Mickey Owens impersonation. With two outs\, Loaiza st
 ruck out Miller\, but the ball hit the dirt\, went under Bennett's glove
  and Jenkins scored on the play.\n\nThe official scorer ruled the play a
  wild pitch\, but the replay showed that it could have been scored a pas
 sed ball. Even Bennett thought he should have caught the ball.\n\n\"I ju
 st missed it\,\" Bennett said. \"I just went down to get it and it caugh
 t my glove and shot off.\"\n\nThe way the Brewers came back in the game 
 reminded Robinson of how the Nationals couldn't hold on to a lead early 
 in the season.\n\n\"What has been disturbing to me is when we score\, we
  give it right back. Remember the first part of the year? It's kind of r
 eminiscent of that with the way we are struggling\,\" Robinson said.\n\n
 It was the Nationals' first victory in the second half of the season and
  it snapped their four-game losing streak. The Nationals remain in first
  place in the National League East\, 1 1/2 games ahead of the Braves.\n\
 n\"We have been struggling a little while. It's better to happen now tha
 n later on in the season\,\" Guillen said \"The game was huge for us tod
 ay. It's going to bring a little bit more confidence back. We'll take ca
 re of one more game\, and then we go home and take care of business.\"\n
 \nSaid Robinson\, \"Right now\, we have to tighten up the belt and ride 
 this thing out a bit\, and we'll get back on track.\"\n\nThis story was

 s to think the Nationals don't want to win bad enough.\n\"It's getting a
  little ridiculous\, to tell you the truth\,\" Wilkerson said. \"Hopeful
 ly\, we can get some momentum and get some confidence. We have to realiz

  If we give it all we have and come up short\, I can go home this offsea
 son and work on next year. If had to go home right now\, I wouldn't feel
  that way.\"\n\nWashington didn't give it all it had on Friday. In fact\
 , David Bell's grand slam proved to be too much for the Nationals\, who 
 were pounded by the Phillies\, 7-1\, in front of 28\,939 at Robert F. Ke
 nnedy Stadium.\n\nThe Nationals are sinking fast in the playoff race. Th
 ey are now eight games behind the Braves in the National League East and
  four games behind the Phillies in the Wild Card race.\n\nLeft-hander Jo
 hn Halama made his second start in a Nationals uniform\, but unlike his 
 previous start\, Halama endured a tough outing. He gave up six runs in t
 hree innings.\n\nWith the score tied at 1\, the Phillies scored five run
 s in the top of the third\, highlighted by a grand slam by Bell. The gra
 nd slam was Bell's first in 127 at-bats with the bases loaded -- ending 
 the longest dry spell in the Major Leagues among active players.\n\nMana
 ger Frank Robinson said the five-run inning took the Nationals out of th
 e ballgame.\n\n\"They score a run in the first inning\,\" Robinson said.
  \"We came back and got one in the second inning. Then Halama goes back 
 out there and you give up five runs. It kind of takes the air of you. Li
 ke I said before\, we don't have the offense that you could count on to 
 put six or seven runs on the board. So when you go out and give up six r
 uns in three innings\, you almost take your team out of the ballgame. Th
 at's what happened tonight.\"\n\nHalama said he didn't feel mechanically
  sound on the mound\, and once he gave up the grand slam to Bell\, Halam
 a knew it for certain.\n\n\"It was supposed to be a sinker away that cut
  inside\,\" Halama said. \"Just one pitch and you are out of it. I caugh
 t myself in between thinking. ... I didn't feel comfortable during the t
 hree innings\, but the third inning was the big one.\"\n\nThe Nationals 
 bullpen has had to come in early in five of their last six games. This t

 e able to add another run off Stanton in that inning when Bobby Abreu dr

DESCRIPTION:Win: 4-3\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nATLANTA -- Since the
  start of the exhibition season\, Nationals manager Frank Robinson has g
 iven his players the green light to steal bases. However\, they have rar
 ely taken advantage of the situation.\nEntering Wednesday's action\, in 
 fact\, the Nationals ranked last in the National League in steals with 3
 3. However\, Brad Wilkerson's attempt to steal a base on Wednesday night
  helped the Nationals edge the Braves\, 4-3\, in the second game of a do
 ubleheader at Turner Field.\n\nThe victory gave the Nationals a split of
  the doubleheader after the Braves won the first game\, 5-3.\n\nIn the n
 ightcap\, the game was tied at 3 when the Nationals scored the go-ahead 
 run in the ninth inning off reliever Chris Reitsma. With Nick Johnson at
  the plate\, Wilkerson attempted to steal third. Braves catcher Brian Mc
 Cann threw the ball into left field and Wilkerson scored the go-ahead ru
 n.\n\n\"That's something I have been looking for all year long\,\" said 
 Robinson\, who celebrated his 70th birthday on Wednesday. \"I guess he d
 ecided to give me a birthday present tonight\, but it's the first time t
 hat we have done that [with any significance]. The green light has been 
 there a lot of times this year\, but we haven't taken advantage of it. I
 f there had to be a first time\, this was a good time for it.\"\n\nWilke
 rson decided to make an attempt to steal because of Reitsma's high leg k
 ick. Wilkerson also gave credit to Johnson for being patient at the plat
 e.\n\n\"I was trying to catch him off guard and go to third base and try
  to make something happen\,\" Wilkerson said. \"Nick did a great job. In
  that situation\, it's very easy to swing at the pitch and foul it back.
  But he was very patient up there and gave me the opportunity to get the
  steal.\"\n\nAsked why the Nationals haven't taken advantage of Robinson
 's green light\, Wilkerson said\, \"I don't think we have enough baseste
 alers on this team. I'm definitely not a basestealer. I get mine here an
 d there.\"\n\nThe winning pitcher was Mike Stanton (1-1)\, while Reitsma
  took the loss and Chad Cordero picked up his Major League-leading 43rd 
 save\, which ties a franchise record set by Expos right-hander John Wett
 eland.\n\nThe Nationals are now six games behind the Braves in the Natio
 nal League East and two games behind the Phillies in the Wild Card race.
 \n\n\"We are all thinking about the division title\,\" Cordero said. \"W
 e don't want to put our goals too short by just thinking about the Wild 
 Card. We still feel we still have a shot at the division.\"\n\nLivan Her
 nandez started for the Nationals and pitched 7 1/3 innings\, giving up t
 hree runs on 10 hits. He struck out three and walked four. Washington ne
 eded Hernandez to go as deep in the game as he did\, because most of the
  relievers have been overworked or injured.\n\n\"Livan was not smooth\, 
 but he was like his old self because he kept us in the ballgame\,\" Robi
 nson said. \"He didn't let the game get away\, and we came up with a win
 .\"\n\nHernandez was given a 1-0 lead in the first\, when Preston Wilson
  doubled down the right-field line off John Thomson to drive in Johnson.
 \n\nBut the Braves quickly tied the score in the bottom of the first\, w
 hen Chipper Jones hit a sacrifice fly to drive in Pete Orr.\n\nThe Natio
 nals had a 3-1 lead by the seventh. In the fifth\, Vidro scored the club
 's second run on a Wilson force out. Two innings later\, Vidro scored th
 e third run on a throwing error by Marcus Giles.\n\nBut the Braves were 
 able to tie the score by the eighth. In the bottom of the seventh\, Ryan
  Langerhans scored on an Orr groundout. An inning later\, with Stanton o
 n the mound\, Wilson Betemit singled to right to drive in Giles (the run
  was charged to Hernandez)\, but right fielder Jose Guillen threw out Ad
 am LaRoche\, who was trying to score the go-ahead run.\n\n\"What can I s
 ay? It was a great throw\,\" Guillen said. \"They had to send the runner
 . They had to try something. They probably have the report that I have a
  banged-up arm and he took a chance. You don't think about anything\, yo
 u try to do your best and let it go. Whatever happens\, happens.\"\n\nTh
 e no-decision meant that Hernandez remained winless against Atlanta in h
 is last 14 starts. The last time he beat the Braves was Aug. 18\, 2000\,
  when he was with the Giants.\n\n\"The team winning is more important to
  me\,\" Hernandez said. \"If I don't pitch well\, I would like to see th
 e team come back and do well\, because it's the only way I lose all my s
 tress from the game.\"\n\nThis story was not subject to the approval of

 s loaded and reliever John Riedling on the mound\, Church hit a shallow 
 fly ball to left field. Miguel Cabrera's throw home was off the mark and
  allowed Jamey Carroll to score easily.\n\n\"Cabrera had to run across a

 right guy at third base. We don't give up. We never feel like we are out
  of the game.\"\n\nCarroll said he already had his mind made up that he 
 was going to score on the play\, even though the ball wasn't hit very de

 ad that kind of set up\,\" Carroll said. \"I took off and hoped it was d

 \"It's just about a step forward for this organization as far as establi

 close to first place. There are still plenty of games left in the season
 .\n\n\"It's great to be a half-game out. The goal is to get to the top\,
 \" Robinson said.\n\nLivan Hernandez and Josh Beckett started the game a
 nd found themselves in a pitchers' duel\, but neither figured in the dec

 its. He threw a season-high 150 pitches -- the most ever by a pitcher ag
 ainst the Marlins -- and 81 of them went for strikes. Hernandez struck o
 ut three and walked five.\n\n\"I threw 137 pitches after eight innings\,
 \" Hernandez said. \"Frank asked me if I can go and I said yes. I felt g

 , power and they have a lot of good pitchers. You have to find a way to 
 beat this team. It was a good game today.\"\n\nRobinson said if he had h
 is way\, he would not have allowed Hernandez to throw that many pitches.
  But as is custom\, Robinson allowed Hernandez to call the shots in term
 s of when the hurler was ready to come out of the game.\n\n\"He knows hi
 mself and he knows what he's capable of doing better than I do\,\" Robin
 son said. \"So as long as he gives me the heads-up sign and I like what 
 I see out there on the mound\, I let him go. But he wasn't going any fur
 ther than nine innings. He lets me know when he has [had] enough.\"\n\nT
 hrowing a lot of pitches is nothing new for Hernandez. He is always amon
 g the league leaders in that category.\n\nIn fact\, while playing for th
 e Cuban National team\, he once pitched 22 games in a season and complet
 ed 19 of them. In one of those games\, he threw more than 170 pitches an
 d won\, 10-9.\n\nBeckett pitched eight solid innings and gave up two run
 s on four hits. He struck out four and walked two.\n\nThe Marlins gave B
 eckett a 2-0 lead in the top of the third inning. With runners on second
  and third and two out\, Juan Encarnacion singled to right field to driv

 off Beckett in the top of the fourth inning. With nobody out\, Jose Guil

SUMMARY:(W) vs Pirates
DESCRIPTION:Win: 3-2\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- Jose G
 uillen's double in the bottom of the eighth inning helped the Nationals 
 defeat the Pirates\, 3-2\, in front of 31\,213 at RFK Stadium on Wednesd
 ay night.\nThe Nationals have now won 14 of their last 15 games at home 
 and improve their record to 46-31. They remain in first place in the Nat
 ional League East\, 3 1/2 games ahead of the Braves.\n\nWith runners on 
 first and second and two outs and reliever Solomon Torres on the mound\,
  Guillen hit a scorcher that glanced off the foot of third baseman Rob M
 ackowiak. The ball rolled near the wall in foul territory\, allowing Car
 los Baerga to score on the play.\n\nThe winning pitcher was Luis Ayala (
 7-4)\, while Chad Cordero picked up his 27th save of the season. Cordero
  has now converted a franchise-record 24 consecutive saves.\n\nJohn Patt
 erson and Dave Williams were the starters for the Nationals and Pirates\
 , respectively\, and neither figured in the decision.\n\nWilliams lasted
  just two innings and gave up one run -- unearned -- on two hits. The ru
 n was scored in the bottom of the first inning. With the bases loaded an
 d one out\, Marlon Byrd hit a sacrifice fly that scored Junior Spivey.\n
 \nWilliams left the game after a two-hour\, eight-minute rain delay.\n\n
 Patterson returned to the mound after the rain delay in the top of the t
 hird inning\, and on the first pitch\, gave up a two-run homer to Mackow
 iak to give the Pirates a 2-1 lead.\n\nBut the Nationals tied the score 
 in the bottom of the fourth off reliever Ryan Vogelsong. With the bases 
 loaded\, Vogelsong walked Guillen to force home Cristian Guzman. It was 
 Guillen's 500th career RBI.\n\nThis story was not subject to the approva

 neider's two-run double helped the Nationals defeat the Braves\, 4-3\, i
 n front of 20\,122 at Turner Field on Tuesday night.\n\nThe Nationals we
 re down\, 3-1\, when they scored three runs in the ninth off Atlanta clo
 ser Dan Kolb\, who suffered his first blown save of the season.\n\nAt fi
 rst\, it looked like the Nationals were not going to cash in on their op
 portunity in that inning. With the bases loaded and no outs\, Ryan Churc
 h grounded out to third baseman Chipper Jones\, who threw home to get Jo
 se Vidro at the plate.\n\nBut Cristian Guzman followed with a sacrifice 
 fly to center field that scored Jose Guillen and cut the lead to 3-2. Gu
 zman said Kolb threw nothing but fastballs\, and Guzman was trying to hi
 t the ball to the outfield.\n\n\"Kolb throws pretty hard fastballs -- 95
  mph -- so I had to make good contact and hit a sacrifice fly\,\" Guzman
  said.\n\nSchneider followed and hit a two-run double to drive in Nick J
 ohnson and Church. Prior to the game\, Schneider was hitless in his last
  three games.\n\n\"Obviously\, we were looking for one run to tie the ga
 me up. I was glad to contribute and get some RBIs and help the team out\
 ,\" Schneider said. \"After Kolb walked the first guy\, you saw a totall
 y different attitude in the dugout. And then we get a knock from Guillen
 . From there\, the attitude just changed in the dugout.\"\n\nAfter close
 r Chad Cordero threw two pitches in the bottom if the ninth\, the umpire
 s delayed the game for 31 minutes because of rain. The umpires did Corde
 ro a favor because the last time he pitched in rain\, he couldn't grip t
 he ball and gave up three runs in two-thirds of an inning against the Bl
 ue Jays in Puerto Rico on July 4.\n\n\"The umpires did me a huge favor\,
 \" Cordero said. \"The grounds crew was able to put the dry [dirt] on th
 e mound. I was able to get a good grip on the ball and wait until the ra
 in stopped. That helped a lot.\"\n\nOnce play resumed\, Cordero picked u
 p his first save of the season and preserved a victory for Luis Ayala (1
 -0)\n\nThree of the Nationals' four victories this season have come when
  they were down in the late innings.\n\n\"It's a big confidence booster.
  We came up with the big hit. It pays to get guys on base with less than
  two out. We did that tonight. We haven't been doing that in the last fe
 w games\,\" outfielder Brad Wilkerson said.\n\nThe victory improved Robi
 nson's demeanor from Monday's 11-2 loss. After the Tuesday's game\, Robi
 nson was scene rapping to the song\, \"In Da Club\" by 50 Cent.\n\nRobin
 son said he is proud of the fact that the Nationals have held their own 
 against tough clubs in the NL East.\n\n\"If we go out to win a ballgame 
 [on Wednesday] and go home one game over .500\, that's a darn good road 
 trip\,\" Robinson said. \"Our goal is to win the series and hold our own
  on the road.\"\n\nRight-hander Esteban Loaiza pitched a solid game for 
 the Nationals. Loaiza pitched seven innings and gave up the three runs o
 n seven hits. He struck out three batters and walked none.\n\nWith the s
 core tied at one\, it looked like Loaiza would lose the game to the Brav
 es in the sixth inning. With runners on first and second and one out\, C
 hipper Jones hit a double to left-center field to drive in Rafael Furcal
  and Pete Orr.\n\nNationals starting pitchers are still looking for thei
 r first victory\, but Loaiza doesn't seem to mind as long as the team is
  winning.\n\n\"Every starter wants to get a win\, but our main goal is t
 o win every single day. If it's not from the starters\, then it's the re
 lievers\,\" Loaiza said. \"The way we played today was a positive thing 
 -- the comeback at the end to score some runs and win the game.\"\n\nBra
 ves right-hander Tim Hudson was a better hurler than Loaiza on Tuesday. 
 He pitched eight innings and gave up one run on six hits. He struck out 
 six batters and walked none.\n\nThe run was scored in the fourth inning 
 when Vidro hit a home run to give the Nationals a 1-0 lead.\n\nThis stor

DTEND;TZID=America/New_York:20050913T220000
DESCRIPTION:Win: 4-2\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nNEW YORK -- It was a
 round 1:30 p.m. ET on Tuesday. Reliever Gary Majewski was already at She
 a Stadium\, and he wanted to know who was going to pitch that night's ga
 me against the Mets.\nIt was already decided that the Nationals were goi
 ng to have a bullpen-by-committee because John Patterson\, the scheduled
  starter\, had been scratched because of a sinus infection and bronchiti
 s that turned into a slight asthma attack.\n\nMajewski was informed by p
 itching coach Randy St. Claire that right-hander Hector Carrasco would s
 tart. Majewski didn't want Carrasco to be taken by surprise\, so he call
 ed his teammate and left a message on his cell phone.\n\nWhen Carrasco h
 eard the message\, he thought it was a joke. But after calling Majewski 
 back\, he realized that Majewski was serious.\n\n\"When Majewski told me
  I was starting\, I said\, 'What?' I started to laugh\,\" said Carrasco.
  \"But I had a feeling [on Monday] I was going to start in the game. I'm
  happy that I did.\"\n\nAs it turned out\, Carrasco pitched four solid i
 nnings and helped the Nationals defeat the Mets\, 4-2\, in front of 34\,
 143.\n\nWashington remains four games behind Florida in the National Lea
 gue Wild Card race.\n\nCarrasco\, making his first start since 2000\, wh
 en he was with the Red Sox\, gave up two runs on three hits. He struck o
 ut a career-high six batters and walked three.\n\nCarrasco admitted that
  he ran out of gas in the top of the fourth inning after running out a g
 round ball he hit off New York starter Tom Glavine.\n\n\"I felt pretty g
 ood\,\" he said. \"It has been a long time since I started a game. I'm h
 appy they let me [do it]. If I had to start again\, I would.\"\n\nAfter 
 Carrasco exited\, Jon Rauch\, Joey Eischen\, Majewski and Chad Cordero s
 hut out the Mets the rest of the way\, with Majewski (4-3) picking up th
 e win and Cordero picking up his 45th save.\n\nMajewski may have receive
 d the win\, but he had nothing but praise for Carrasco.\n\n\"Hector did 
 above and beyond what he was called to do\,\" said Majewski. \"Throwing 
 four innings\, when you throw no more than two innings a game all year\,
  is hard to do. The first couple of innings\, he had 40 pitches. He goes
  out there and doesn't think it's a pressure situation. He never said\, 
 'I'm starting\, I'm not used to doing it this year.' He has done it in t
 he past. He knows how to handle himself. He did one [heck] of a job.\"\n
 \nThe Nationals most likely will use another reliever to start on Saturd
 ay\, against the Padres -- they don't have a fourth or fifth starter at 
 their disposal because of the shoulder injuries to Tony Armas Jr. and Ry
 an Drese. The Nationals are not going to have any callups\, and Robinson
  doesn't have a pitcher in the bullpen who could eat innings.\n\n\"We ha
 ve to use the guys that were out there tonight\,\" said Robinson. \"It m
 ight be in reverse order.\"\n\nPrior to Tuesday's outing\, Glavine handl
 ed the Nationals pretty well this season. He was 2-0 with a 2.84 ERA\, a
 nd managed to retire the Nationals.\n\nBut\, on Tuesday\, the Nationals 
 were finally able to figure him out. The Mets were up\, 1-0\, when the N
 ationals took the lead in the third inning.\n\nWith runners on first and
  third and no outs\, Brad Wilkerson singled to center field to drive in 
 Cristian Guzman. Marlon Byrd followed and drove in Carrasco with another
  single.\n\nAfter Jose Guillen hit a slow liner to shortstop Jose Reyes\
 , Preston Wilson singled to left to score Wilkerson and give the Nationa
 ls a 3-1 lead.\n\n\"It was a 2-0 count\, and I know Glavine really didn'
 t want to give in to me\, so I was able to stay on the changeup and driv
 e it to the hole\,\" said Wilson. \"We were able to get some hits at the
  right time. That's how it goes. Anybody can be beat on any given night.
 \"\n\nThe Mets made it a 3-2 game in the fourth inning\, when Marlon And
 erson took Carrasco's 1-0 pitch and hit his fourth home run of the seaso
 n.\n\nIn the top of the ninth\, with Braden Looper on the mound and Bria
 n Schneider on first base\, Guzman dropped a bunt in front of catcher Ra
 mon Castro\, who lobbed the ball over the head of first baseman Chris Wo
 odward. Schneider scored all the way from first on the play to give the 
 Nationals the 4-2 lead.\n\nThe game had more than its share of wacky mom
 ents. With Rauch on the mound\, it appeared that Mets outfielder Victor 
 Diaz swung at a 1-0 pitch. Home-plate umpire Jeff Nelson didn't see the 
 play\, so he asked for help from first-base umpire Bill Miller\, who sai
 d that Diaz didn't swing.\n\nRobinson argued for several minutes with Ne
 lson from the dugout\, and would eventually be ejected for arguing balls
  and strikes. Suddenly\, Robinson came out of the dugout to argue with N
 elson.\n\nCrew chief Joe Brinkman\, who was serving as second-base umpir
 e\, intervened and told Robinson to get off the field. At one point\, Br
 inkman grabbed Robinson's uniform top. According to Robinson\, Brinkman 
 swore at him several times.\n\n\"He was ejected\,\" said Brinkman. \"It 
 was a prolonged argument\, and finally\, I told him to get off the field
 .\"\n\nAsked if he used explicit language\, Brinkman said\, \"I don't kn
 ow if I did or not\, to tell you the truth. I just told him to get out.\

 Robinson said that if the Nationals had lost Saturday's game against the
  Phillies\, it would have been time to pull the plug on the season. But 
 the Nationals were resuscitated a little after 11 p.m. ET.\nThat's when 
 Preston Wilson's single in the bottom of the 12th inning helped the Nati
 onals defeat the Phillies\, 5-4\, in front of 30\,561 at RFK Stadium and
  remain in the thick of the National League Wild Card race.\n\nThe Natio
 nals now find themselves three games behind the Phillies\, who have a ha
 lf-game lead over the Astros and Marlins.\n\nWith a runner on second\, o
 ne out and Aquilino Lopez on the mound\, Wilson blooped a single to righ
 t field to drive in Jose Guillen for the game-winning run. It was the Na
 tionals' first extra-inning win since they beat the Cubs in 12 innings o
 n July 3.\n\n\"Any time you are playing teams that are our rivals\, the 
 wins are big\,\" said Wilson. \"We definitely need to play well\, play i
 nspired and feel like we have something to lose.\"\n\nFor the first time
  in weeks\, the Nationals were jumping on one another\, giving one anoth
 er high-fives.\n\n\"We haven't had any dramatic wins in the second half\
 ,\" said Robinson. \"They could have thrown in the towel very easily aft
 er the ninth inning. We stuck with it\, and we won.\"\n\nThe winning pit
 cher was Hector Carrasco (4-3)\, and Lopez (0-1) took the loss.\n\nThe N
 ationals had needed right-hander John Patterson to go deep into Saturday
 's game\, as the bullpen has been overworked. He did just that\, pitchin
 g 7 2/3 innings and giving up one run on five hits. He struck out eight 
 batters and walked one.\n\n\"John Patterson didn't have his electric stu
 ff\, but he got better as the game went along\,\" said Robinson. \"It sh
 ows you how far he has come this year -- to go out without his best stuf

 end\, it looked like he had found his stuff.\"\n\nThe Nationals scored t

 th runners on first and second and one out\, Wilson hit a ball down the 
 left-field line. David Bell dove for the ball\, but it hit the ground fo
 r a double. Deivi Cruz scored\, but Nick Johnson was thrown out on the p
 lay.\n\nAfter Vinny Castilla singled to put runners on first and third\,
  Marlon Byrd hit an infield single to score Wilson for the second run of
  the game.\n\nPat Burrell cut the lead to 2-1 by taking a 2-1 pitch from
  Patterson over the left-field wall.\n\nThe Phillies had a chance to bre
 ak open the game in the bottom of the eighth inning. Patterson exited af

 Left-hander Joey Eischen entered and walked Chase Utley to load the base
 s. But Eischen managed to get Bobby Abreu to strike out to end the innin
 g.\n\n\"I was fired up\,\" said Eischen. \"I think everybody could tell.
  It was Patty's game\, and all the stuff that he worked for was on the l

DESCRIPTION:Win: 4-3\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- A four
 -run fourth inning helped the Nationals defeat the Cubs\, 4-3\, in front
  of 42\,829 at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium on Saturday night.\nThe victory
  snapped the Nationals' three-game losing streak and improved their reco
 rd to 19-17.\n\nThe game was delayed two hours and 40 minutes because of
  rain. After play began\, starter Livan Hernandez found himself behind\,
  1-0\, after three-plus innings because of an RBI double by Corey Patter
 son in the third inning. But the Nationals gave Hernandez the lead in th
 e bottom of the fourth off Cubs starter Carlos Zambrano.\n\nWith the bas
 es loaded and one out\, Vinny Castilla gave the Nationals a 2-1 lead whe
 n he singled to left field to drive home Brad Wilkerson and Jamey Carrol
 l. On the same play\, Castilla and Nick Johnson found themselves on seco
 nd and third\, respectively\, after a throwing error by left fielder Jas
 on Dubois.\n\n\"Zambrano threw some nasty sinkers. I was fortunate that 
 he left the ball a little bit up and I was able to put good wood on the 
 ball\,\" Castilla said.\n\nRyan Church then gave the Nationals a 3-1 lea
 d with another single to left field to drive in Johnson.\n\nAfter Brian 
 Schneider was hit by a pitch\, Cristian Guzman singled to left field to 
 bring home Castilla.\n\n\"Zambrano went after us early in the game and t
 hat allowed some swinging and misses. But we started to be patient and g
 ot pitches to hit\,\" said Wilkerson\, who went 1-for-4 in the game.\n\n
 Manager Frank Robinson was relieved that the Nationals were able to scor
 e some runs. In their last four losses\, they have left 39 runners on ba
 se.\n\n\"We have been missing the big hit. We have been getting the one 
 hit. But tonight\, we got the second and the third hit\, which makes a d
 ifference. Instead of scoring one or two runs\, we scored four\,\" Robin
 son said. \"It was nice to see and we needed every one of those hits.\n\
 n\"That's what happens when we give our pitchers some cushion. They have
  been coming from behind or they have been in tied ballgames. Things hav
 e been happening to us and clubs have been beating us. Tonight we had a 
 cushion\, and it was enough.\"\n\nThe rally helped Hernandez win his fif
 th consecutive game\, but it would prove to be bittersweet. He left the 
 game with one out in the seventh inning because of right knee inflammati
 on. After hitting Jerry Hairston with a pitch\, Hernandez motioned to Ro
 binson to take him out of the game. Hernandez will be evaluated further

DESCRIPTION:Win: 4-0\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nMIAMI -- Before Mond
 ay's game\, right-hander Hector Carrasco told manager Frank Robinson tha
 t he wanted to pitch nine innings against the Marlins and help save the 
 bullpen.\nHe was three innings short\, but he did help the Nationals bla
 nk the Marlins\, 4-0\, in front of 11\,467 at Dolphins Stadium.\n\nCarra
 sco (5-3)\, making his fourth consecutive start\, gave up only two hits\
 , struck out six batters and walked three. Robinson said that Carrasco w
 asn't going to complete the game anyway\, as he was pitching on three da
 ys' rest.\n\nCarrasco hasn't given up a run in his last 17 2/3 innings. 
 The only time he was in trouble on Monday was in the first inning. The M
 arlins had the bases loaded and no outs\, but he got Juan Encarnacion to
  fly out to Brad Wilkerson in left field and induced Mike Lowell to hit 
 into a double play to end the inning.\n\n\"Hector has been a nice\, plea
 sant surprise with another great effort on his part tonight\,\" said Rob
 inson. \"He has pitched four good starts. I don't know how he does it at
  this stage of the season. He seems to thrive on it.\"\n\nThe 35-year-ol
 d Carrasco\, who lowered his ERA to 1.73\, is surprised that he has been
  able to make the successful transition from reliever to starter.\n\n\"T
 his is the first time in my career that I've been pitching the way I've 
 been pitching\,\" said Carrasco. \"But I'm going to keep doing this. I h
 ave a lot of confidence in myself\, and I'm not afraid.\"\n\nMarlins lef
 t-hander Jason Vargas was just as effective\, pitching seven innings and
  giving up one run on five hits.\n\nThat one run was scored in the secon
 d inning\, when Cristian Guzman drove in Nick Johnson with a single to l
 eft field.\n\nThe Nationals scored three insurance runs off reliever Ant
 onio Alfonseca in the top of the eighth inning. Ryan Zimmerman singled u
 p the middle to drive in Jamey Carroll.\n\n\"He left a slider over the p
 late\,\" said the 20-year-old Zimmerman. \"I was trying to stay back. I 
 felt I was a little jumpy in the first few at-bats.\"\n\nZimmerman\, who
  is expected to be the everyday third baseman next year\, went 2-for-4\,
  raising his batting average to .421 and his RBI total to six. He is not
  surprised by his success at the plate.\n\n\"I have confidence in myself
 \,\" he said. \"I believe I can perform up here.\"\n\nGuzman put the ici
 ng on the cake by driving in two more runs with a double down the left-f
 ield line off Alfonseca.\n\n\"He has been our offensive weapon the last 
 month\,\" said Robinson. \"Another big game from him. At least he is a t
 hreat up there at the plate now\, which makes a big difference down in t
 he bottom of the lineup.\"\n\nOverall\, Guzman went 3-for-4 with three R
 BIs and raised his average to .215. It's his highest batting average sin
 ce May 15\, when he hit .226. Guzman is having his best month of the sea
 son\, hitting .328 (21-for-64).\n\n\"I feel good\,\" said Guzman. \"Like
  I [said] all year\, when you do something in the game\, you have to be 
 happy. For me\, I want the season to start right now\, but it's almost o
 ver. I'm going to keep going the last five games and improve the numbers
 .\"\n\nThe victory snapped the Nationals' three-game losing streak and i
 mproved their record to 79-78.\n\n\"They see the finish line\, but they 
 don't want this season to slip away and finish under .500\,\" said Robin

DESCRIPTION:Win: 6-3\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nNEW YORK -- Prior to
  Wednesday's action\, the last time the Nationals faced Kris Benson was 
 on Aug. 21 at Shea Stadium\, and Benson couldn't get past the first inni
 ng\, giving up six runs in two-thirds of an inning.\nOn Wednesday night\
 , the Nationals faced him again and he managed to pitch five innings\, b
 ut Washington still hit him hard. In fact\, it took solo home runs by Pr
 eston Wilson and Vinny Castilla to chase Benson and help the Nationals d
 efeat Mets\, 6-3\, in front of 24\,049 at Shea Stadium.\n\nAt first it l
 ooked like the Nationals could be headed for disaster in the top of the 
 fifth. With one out and the score tied at 3\, right fielder Jose Guillen
  was called out on strikes by home plate umpire Bill Miller. He thought 
 the last two pitches that Miller called for strikes were low and inside.
 \n\nGuillen went into the dugout\, complained about the strike calls and
  was ejected. Guillen then threw a helmet\, four bats\, batting gloves a
 nd shin guards in the direction of the umpire.\n\n\"I'm a grown man\,\" 
 Guillen said. \"I take full responsibility for what I did. It was a ball
 . I don't like it. I let my anger come out. I did whatever I needed to d
 o. If nobody likes it\, they could come and talk to me and we can talk a
 bout it like a man.\"\n\nMiller disagreed with Guillen's assessment abou
 t the strikes calls.\n\n\"Both of them were strikes\,\" Miller said \"I 
 don't think I should say [why he was tossed]. He cursed out of the dugou
 t\, and immediately got run. Before he threw his helmet\, he went to the
  dugout. He yelled and cursed at me out of the dugout. I ejected him. Th
 at's it.\"\n\nLosing Guillen for the rest of the game had no affect on t
 he Nationals. Wilson\, who was the next hitter\, blasted a monster home 
 run that landed in the mezzanine section near the left-field foul pole.\
 n\n\"I was just focusing on the pitcher. Whatever is done is done\,\" sa
 id Wilson\, when asked if Guillen ejection motivated the team. \"I moved
  on\, got out of his way and tried to think what the pitcher was trying 
 to do and what he has done to me in my previous at-bats.\"\n\nDuring his
  career\, Wilson has hit 21 home runs and has driven in 54 runs against 
 the Mets. It's the most damage he has done to a team. Asked if there was
  motivation to play against the team that drafted and traded him\, Wilso
 n said he felt at home at Shea. As a kid he watched his stepfather\, Moo
 kie Wilson play for the Mets from 1980-89.\n\n\"I feel at home here. I g
 rew up in this ballpark\,\" Wilson said. \"I've always enjoyed being her
 e\, I enjoyed playing here. I enjoy playing in center field because they
  have that big speaker in center field. When they play the music\, I'm o
 ut there bobbing my head.\"\n\nCastilla followed Wilson's lead by hittin
 g a home run of his own over the center-field fence to give the National
 s a two-run lead. It's the fourth time this season that Washington has h
 it back-to-back home runs in a game.\n\n\"I was trying to hit the ball h
 ard somewhere\,\" Castilla said. \"He threw me a ball that I could handl
 e and I hit it hard.\"\n\nBenson (9-8) pitched five innings and gave up 
 five runs on eight hits. He has now lost five straight games.\n\n\"I don
 't think that my location is killing me right now\,\" Benson said. \"I j
 ust think it's what I'm throwing at certain points in the count. I need 
 to come up with a better pitch in time.\n\n\"I'm hitting my spots like I
  should be\, but they're taking too good of hacks on balls that I'm thro
 wing up there\, so there's obviously a problem with the selection I'm ta
 king with each batter.\"\n\nThe Nationals scored their final run of the 
 game in the ninth inning when Nick Johnson drove in Brad Wilkerson with 
 a single to right field off Tim Hamulack. The run was charged to Aaron H
 eilman.\n\nEsteban Loaiza (11-10) earned the victory\, pitching seven in
 nings and allowing three runs on seven hits. He threw just 94 pitches an
 d 63 of them were for strikes. The Nationals needed Loaiza to go deep in
 to the game because the bullpen has been overworked\, and they are expec
 ted to have a bullpen-by-committee on Saturday against the Padres.\n\nLo
 aiza is expected to pitch on three days' rest on Sunday against the Padr
 es.\n\n\"It was important for him to go seven tonight\,\" manager Frank 
 Robinson said. \"He didn't have a high pitch count\, so he should be OK 
 on Sunday. We got our cake and ate it\, too\, tonight.\"\n\nTwo of those
  three runs scored when Loaiza didn't cover first base on ground balls t
 o Johnson.\n\n\"He had brain cramps\,\" Robinson said. \"He was a specta
 tor. It didn't hurt us tonight\, but it will hurt you another time you d
 o it. The Mets are struggling and they didn't take advantage of things.\
 "\n\nRelievers Gary Majewski and Chad Cordero shutout the Mets the rest 
 of the way\, with Cordero picking up his 46th save of the season.\n\nThe
  Nationals are three games behind the Phillies and Marlins in the Wild C
 ard race -- as well as 2 1/2 games behind the Astros -- and Robinson sti
 ll feels that his team has a chance to go to the playoffs.\n\n\"As long 
 we do our part of it\, we should have a chance.\" Robinson said. \"All w

 arlier this week\, right-hander John Patterson was promoted from the fif
 th spot to the second slot in the rotation and he took advantage of the 
 situation on Saturday. He pitched seven shutout innings and helped the N
 ationals defeat the Diamondbacks\, 9-3\, in front of 34\,943 fans at Rob
 ert F. Kennedy Stadium.\n\nThe Nationals have now won eight straight gam
 es against Arizona. The last time the Nationals won eight straight over 
 a team was back in the early 1990s\, when they won 15 straight against t
 he Padres from July 25\, 1993\, to May 23\, 1995.\n\nPatterson\, who sta
 rted his Major League career with the Diamondbacks\, gave up four hits\,
  struck out six batters and walked only one. All six batters were called
  out on strikes.\n\nThe Diamondbacks never made a serious threat against
  Patterson. They had a runner on second base with less than two outs onl
 y once in the game against the right-hander\, and that was in the first 
 inning\, when Royce Clayton doubled with one out. Clayton\, however was 
 quickly ousted when he tried to steal third.\n\nNationals third baseman 
 Vinny Castilla was the hitting hero for the second consecutive game. He 
 went 3-for-3 with a home run and four RBIs\, and was a triple short of t
 he cycle. During the home opener on Thursday\, Castilla had exactly the 
 same numbers\, and was a single short of the cycle.\n\nCastilla gave the
  Nationals the lead by taking Russ Ortiz's 2-2 pitch and hitting the bal

DESCRIPTION:Win: 6-3\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nPHILADELPHIA -- Fran
 k Robinson is not even thinking about winning the Wild Card race. He wan
 ts something better. He wants the Nationals to win the division title.\n
 A couple of hours before the Nationals played the Phillies on Monday\, R
 obinson said that winning at least two games in Philadelphia was a must 
 and that it would be great to take three out of four.\n\nThe Nationals w
 ere closer to reaching those goals after they used the longball to pound
  the Phillies\, 6-3\, in front of 40\,627 at Citizens Bank Park on Monda
 y night.\n\nThe Nationals\, who have won four consecutive games\, moved 
 into second place in the National League East\, cut the Braves' lead in 
 the division to five games and are still one game behind the Astros in t
 he Wild Card race.\n\nIt was the Preston Wilson show\, as he had his bes
 t game as a member of the Nationals\, hitting two homers and driving in 
 four runs. Since last Friday\, when Robinson put him back in center fiel
 d\, Wilson is 6-for-16 (.375) with two home runs and seven RBIs. Overall
 \, he is hitting .252 with six home runs and 18 RBIs as a National.\n\n\
 "That's something we hoped he could do for us when we got him\,\" said R
 obinson. \"Tonight he had one of those games\, and we needed it. He was 
 the big guy tonight\, along with the supporting cast.\"\n\nNick Johnson\
 , however\, gave the Nationals a 1-0 lead by hitting a home run in the f
 irst inning off Brett Myers (10-6).\n\nIn the same inning\, Wilson incre
 ased the lead to 3-0 by hitting a two-run home run over the center-field
  fence.\n\n\"It feels good to contribute to a win\,\" said Wilson. \"Tha
 t's going to be the thing about us down the stretch. It going to be a di
 fferent night and a different guy [who will contribute]. Everybody is go
 ing to do their part and chip in. We are just going to do it from here o
 n out.\"\n\nBut the Phillies quickly made it a 3-2 game in the bottom of
  the first\, when Pat Burrell hit a two-run single off right-hander Liva
 n Hernandez (14-5).\n\n\"I had a lot of problems in the first inning the
  last four games\,\" said Hernandez. \"The only way you could get out of
  it [was to] just pitch and not care about the first inning.\"\n\nHernan
 dez went on to throw eight solid innings\, giving up two runs on five hi
 ts. He struck out three and walked two. It was his best outing since Jul
 y 31\, when he pitched eight strong innings against the Marlins.\n\n\"He
  started separating his fastball from his offspeed pitches\,\" said Robi
 nson. \"His velocity on the fastball went up to 88 to 89 miles per hour.
  That makes a big difference in his pitches. He is much more effective p
 itching that way.\"\n\nThe Nationals put away the game on a controversia
 l home run by Wilson. After Jose Guillen walked with two outs\, Wilson t
 ook a 2-2 pitch from Myers and hit a ball that appeared to have hit the 
 top of the right center-field fence\, but there was confusion on the pla
 y.\n\nSecond-base umpire Ted Barrett put his arms in the air and ruled a
  ground-rule double\, but first-base umpire Alfonso Marquez signaled a h
 ome run.\n\nAfter Wilson circled the bases\, Phillies manager Charlie Ma
 nuel protested the home-run call with Marquez. The umpires then huddled 
 and ruled that Wilson had\, indeed\, hit a home run.\n\n\"I saw two diff
 erent calls. It's not [Barrett's] call. That's where all the confusion c
 ame from\,\" said Robinson. \"I don't know if the conference was necessa
 ry\, to tell you the truth.\"\n\nInstant replay had a tough time showing
  what really happened. One angle showed that the ball hit the top of the
  fence\, but from another angle it appeared that the ball hit a fan\, th
 en bounced onto the field.\n\nIn the eighth\, Brian Schneider made it a 
 6-2 game with his solo shot off Geoff Geary.\n\nChad Cordero picked up h
 is 38th save after giving up an unearned run in the ninth.\n\nWhen asked
  if the Nationals were back to the winning ways of the season's first ha
 lf\, Robinson said\, \"If you want to say it\, yeah. But I'm not going t
 o jump on the wagon now and say\, 'Yes\, indeed\, we're back.' But we ce
 rtainly have a nice mixture of good pitching\, and the offense has come 
 to life\, and that has been the key. We are scoring runs now\, and pitch
 ers are able to make a mistake and not have the game on the line. \"\n\n

DESCRIPTION:Win: 8-7\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nPHILADELPHIA -- One 
 thing is obvious about the Nationals during the first half of the 2005 s
 eason. They don't win games easily\, and Friday night was no different.\
 nThe Nationals nearly let two five-run leads slip away\, but edged the P
 hillies\, 8-7\, in front of 44\,688 at Citizens Bank Park on Friday nigh
 t.\n\nIt was the Nationals' 24th one-run victory\, which leads the Major
  Leagues.\n\n\"I don't know what it is\,\" first baseman Carlos Baerga s
 aid. \"We try to have big games that are easy for us. But we make them c
 lose.\"\n\nAs it turned out\, the sixth inning was key for the Nationals
 . They were leading\, 5-3\, when they scored three more runs off left-ha
 nded reliever Aaron Fultz. With runners on first and second and two outs
 \, Baerga hit a three-run homer over the left-field wall.\n\n\"When I hi
 t it\, I thought it was going to hit the wall. I hit it pretty good\, bu
 t the ball stayed in the air. Those were some big RBIs there\,\" Baerga 
 said. \"It was big\, because the Phillies kept coming back. In this ball
 park\, you never know what could happen. They could come back at any tim
 e. They have power\, too.\"\n\nBut the Phillies played small ball instea
 d and made it a one-run game in the bottom of the sixth. With Joey Eisch
 en on the mound\, Endy Chavez tripled to right-center field to bring hom
 e Todd Pratt.\n\nReliever Luis Ayala entered the game and had a tough ti
 me getting people out. Tomas Perez singled to drive in Chavez and make i
 t an 8-5 game.\n\nAfter Kenny Lofton singled\, Bobby Abreu struck out an
 d Pat Burrell walked to load the bases\, Chase Utley hit a sacrifice fly
  to send home Perez.\n\nRyan Howard was the next hitter\, and he doubled
  over Brad Wilkerson's head in center field. While Lofton scored\, Wilke
 rson threw a perfect relay to shortstop Jamey Carroll who threw home to 
 catcher Brian Schneider\, in time to nail Burrell at the plate to end th
 e inning and preserve the one-run lead.\n\n\"[The play] was executed per
 fectly\,\" manager Frank Robinson said. \"If Jamey doesn't finish it off
 \, it doesn't mean anything. It was an outstanding throw to home plate. 
 It was a good play all around.\"\n\nWilkerson said once he grabbed the b
 all\, he knew he had a chance to get Burrell at the plate.\n\n\"It's a p
 lay where I know that I wasn't going to catch the ball\,\" Wilkerson sai
 d. \"I just tried to play the carom off the wall\, and it just bounced t
 o me perfectly. I made a good relay\, and Jamey made a great throw home\
 , and we got the guy. If the Phillies tie the game\, it's a different st
 ory.\"\n\nThe play turned the momentum around in the Nationals' favor. R
 eliever Gary Majewski entered the game in the seventh\, and after allowe
 d the first two runners he faced to get on\, he blanked the Phillies for
  two innings. It helped that the Nationals were able to retire David Bel
 l in a rundown between third and home in the seventh.\n\nCloser Chad Cor
 dero shut out the Phillies in the ninth to pick up his 31st save. But th
 e Nationals had a close call in that inning.\n\nWith one out\, Howard hi
 t a long fly ball to center field. The sound off Howard's bat was so lou
 d that Robinson told bench coach Eddie Rodriguez\, \"Home run.\" However
 \, Wilkerson caught the ball just in front of the 401-foot sign.\n\n\"We
  got lucky tonight because we didn't allow them to pull the ball\,\" Rob
 inson said. \"The way the wind was blowing\, it kind of kept the balls i
 n the ballpark\, and center field is probably the only place they do kee
 p it in the ballpark.\n\n\"When he hit\, it sounded great. That's what a

 , on the other hand\, didn't think the ball was going to travel that far
  to deep center field.\n\n\"I saw Wilky go farther and farther back. The
 n I thought it might have a chance for a home run\,\" Cordero said. \"Th

SUMMARY:(W) vs Astros
DESCRIPTION:Win: 4-0\n\nBy David Selig / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- All we
 ek\, the Nationals have been talking about the play they needed to end t
 heir offensive struggles and get back on track in their pursuit to win t
 he National League East.\nNobody could describe that play\, whether it b
 e a clutch home run or a lucky bounce\, or say definitively when it woul
 d happen.\n\nWith the bases loaded and two outs in the first inning on S
 aturday\, Carlos Baerga appeared to have extended the Nationals' string 
 of untimely hitting with a flare that seemed destined for the glove of A
 stros center fielder Willy Taveras. But the liner to left-center field s
 uddenly became what may turn out to be that enigmatic and previously una
 ttainable play.\n\n\"I knew when I hit that ball that it was going to be
  farther\,\" said Baerga. \"I was jogging to first base when I saw [Tave
 ras] come in. I started running and saw everybody running. I think it wa
 s like [the movie] Angels in the Outfield. God sent somebody over there 
 for the ball to come down.\"\n\nWhen the ball found a vacant patch of gr
 ass over the rookie outfielder's head\, Brad Wilkerson\, Jose Guillen an
 d Preston Wilson rushed home as if they had never been there before\, an
 d the Nationals had all the scoring necessary for a 4-2 victory.\n\n\"Th
 at's what we've been missing\,\" said manager Frank Robinson of Baerga's
  timely double. \"It's hard to describe how badly we needed it\, but we 
 needed it very bad.\"\n\nAfter Brian Schneider singled home Baerga to ex
 tend the lead to 4-0\, the 42\,680 relieved fans at RFK Stadium focused 
 their attention on starter Tony Armas Jr.\n\nArmas -- who left his start
  in the third inning on Monday because of dizziness and dehydration -- m
 ust have thought he was hallucinating when he witnessed the Nationals' b
 iggest first-inning outburst of the season.\n\nBut the right-hander was 
 full of fluids on a night when the weather was cooler than it had been a
 ll week. He recognized the early lead\, and with confidence he attacked 
 a team coming off a 14-1 win on Friday.\n\n\"I was just trying to keep t
 he ball down and get my outs\,\" said Armas. \"That seemed like the firs
 t time I saw that many runs.\"\n\nArmas held the Astros hitless through 
 5 1/3 innings before allowing a two-run homer to Lance Berkman on his 97
 th pitch of the night. He wound up allowing just that one hit in seven i
 nnings.\n\nAs Robinson predicted to the media before the game\, Chad Cor
 dero iced the win with his 34th save. After Cordero surrendered two sing
 les to make the ninth inning interesting\, Robinson knew\, \"the Nationa
 ls are back.\"\n\n\"We won it the way we won a lot of games this year\, 
 so that makes us feel a little bit more comfortable\,\" said Robinson. \
 "If we went out there and blew them out 10-0\, I don't think it would ha
 ve served as much purpose as much as this 4-2 game\, because that's our 
 type of game. If we can get back to that\, we're going to win our share 
 of games.\"\n\nThe starting pitching and bullpen were essential in the v
 ictory\, but if it wasn't for that play in the first\, Eminem's blaring 
 rap in the home clubhouse would have been replaced by a post-game silenc
 e that has become far too familiar for the Nationals.\n\nWhat made the p
 lay even more significant was the fact that the Nationals had caught ano
 ther poor bounce earlier in the rally.\n\nGuillen\, who has recently com
 plained about not being able to get the ball out of spacious RFK Stadium
 \, did just that with a ground-rule double. Had the ball stayed in play\
 , Wilkerson would have been able to score from first. But when the ball 
 caromed into the bullpen -- and off the head of Sun-Woo Kim -- Wilkerson
  was stranded at third until Baerga drove him in.\n\n\"We were due for a
  break\,\" said Wilkerson. \"That's the way we've been winning baseball 
 games.\"\n\nIt had been more than a month since the Nats scored four run
 s in an inning\, and they hadn't tallied more than four in a game in the
  previous six days.\n\nBut all is not necessarily fixed. Robinson\, who 
 would seem to have spoken to Baerga's angels by his pregame prognosticat
 ion of victory\, also said on Saturday afternoon that it would take more
  than one key hit for the Nationals to escape their struggles.\n\nThe te
 am won\, 4-0\, against Colorado on Tuesday\, but that has been nearly fo
 rgotten thanks to the slump that began the next day.\n\nSo the Nats real
 ize that it will take more than one win\, even when that win came under 
 atypical circumstances after a wakeup call the previous night.\n\n\"A lo
 ss doesn't turn it around\,\" said the veteran Baerga. \"Wins turn it ar
 ound. The biggest win is going to be tomorrow. To come back with two gam
 es in a row ... We haven't done that in a while.\"\n\n\nThis story was n

DESCRIPTION:Loss: 3-4\n\nBy Pete Kerzel / Special to MLB.com\n\nWASHINGT
 ON -- Livan Hernandez could have opted for the surgeon's knife in the mi
 ddle of the season\, when the pain in his right knee became so frustrati
 ngly intense that the only way for him to pitch was to alter his deliver
 y.\nUtilizing a more upright motion robbed him of his ability to push of
 f with his right leg\, but Hernandez wasn't about to crumble under a swo
 llen knee\, not when there were starts to make and games to win.\n\nHern
 andez could have packed it in when the Washington Nationals wilted in th
 e summer\, but that's when the right-hander thought his team needed him 
 the most. He took the mound\, again and again\, piling up innings and go
 bbling down anti-inflammatory medication.\n\nThe big right-hander could 
 have even begged off from his final start\, a meaningless game for a tea
 m already eliminated from contention. Hernandez is scheduled for surgery
  Wednesday in Miami\, a built-in\, but understandable\, excuse if ever h
 e needed one.\n\nBut pride got in the way\, and he produced a 130-pitch 
 effort that speaks volumes about the ace of the Washington staff.\n\nHer
 nandez gutted through seven innings in his National League-high 35th sta
 rt of the season\, absorbing his 10th loss as the Philadelphia Phillies 
 remained alive in the NL Wild Card race with a 4-3 victory Friday night.
 \n\n\"The doctor told me I can pitch like that. ... The knee is not goin
 g to be perfect anymore\,\" Hernandez said. \"It's better that he fix it
  now\, better than in the middle of the year. I'm the kind of guy who li
 kes to play.\"\n\nHernandez (15-10) gave up four runs on 10 hits\, walke
 d two and struck out six in falling to 3-7 since the All-Star break. He'
 s matched his high for starts and has logged a league-leading 246 1/3 in
 nings -- 8 1/3 innings shy of the career-best mark he set last season --
  making his teammates marvel at his resilience.\n\n\"He's a warrior\,\" 
 outfielder Ryan Church said. \"If they'd have let him\, he'd have stayed
  out there and thrown 200 pitches.\"\n\nAdded second baseman Jamey Carro
 ll: \"We know he's been hurting for a majority of the season. But he's b
 een battling for us\; it makes you want to go out there and battle for h
 im.\"\n\nUncomfortable with the role of spoiler\, the Nationals were not
  lacking motivation against the Phillies.\n\nWashington\, which had won 
 three straight\, needs a victory in one of its final two games of the se
 ason against Philadelphia to guarantee the 15th winning season in the fr
 anchise's 37-year history.\n\n\"We know what they're going after and we 
 want to stop them from it\,\" Carroll said.\n\nHernandez's stubbornness 
 notwithstanding\, Washington couldn't convert the opportunities presente
 d by Phillies right-hander Cory Lidle (13-11)\, who allowed six hits and
  one earned run through 6 2/3 innings.\n\nLidle let the Nationals take a
  1-0 lead in the first\, when Preston Wilson's groundout scored Brad Wil
 kerson\, who had doubled and moved to third on a Nick Johnson bouncer. A
 fter that\, Lidle allowed only one unearned run on a throwing error by J
 immy Rollins\, who stretched his hitting streak to 34 games with a third
 -inning single.\n\nRyan Howard's 21st homer tied the game in the second\
 , and a two-run third\, fueled by a poor play by Wilson in center field 
 and a pair of stolen bases against backup catcher Gary Bennett\, made it
  3-1.\n\nRollins led off the frame with a single\, stole second and came
  home on Chase Utley's one-out single to right. Utley moved to third on 
 Bobby Abreu's deep fly and scored easily when Wilson misjudged Pat Burre
 ll's drive to the wall in right-center.\n\nWilson scored in the fourth\,
  trimming the lead to 4-2. He singled with one out\, went to second on R
 yan Zimmerman's single to left and came home when Rollins threw wildly o
 n a double-play relay to first.\n\nLidle retired the side in order in th
 e second and third\, but allowed at least a baserunner in each of his la
 st four innings. He departed in the seventh\, after giving up an infield
  single to Cristian Guzman and a pinch-hit single to Carlos Baerga.\n\n\
 "We just couldn't break through on Lidle\,\" Nationals manager Frank Rob
 inson lamented.\n\nUgueth Urbina got the Phillies out of the seventh-inn
 ing jam\, but got himself into trouble in the eighth when Johnson led of
 f with a single and Church drew a two-out walk. Billy Wagner got the fin
 al four outs\, allowing a ninth-inning run along the way\, for his 37th 
 save.\n\nThis story was not subject to the approval of Major League Base

SUMMARY:(L) vs Braves
DESCRIPTION:Loss: 0-4\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- After
  Friday's victory against the Braves\, manager Frank Robinson said that 
 he would love Washington to put together a winning streak and gain groun
 d in the National League Wild Card race.\nBut the Nationals were not abl
 e to win their second straight game. One bad inning proved to be costly 
 for right-hander Livan Hernandez\, and Washington was blanked by Atlanta
 \, 4-0\, in front of 44\,083 at RFK Stadium on Saturday afternoon.\n\nTh
 e Nationals\, who have been shut out 11 times this season\, are now four
  games behind the Astros in the Wild Card race. Houston defeated Milwauk
 ee\, 7-5\, on Saturday night while the Marlins beat the Phillies\, 7-6.\
 n\n\"We don't seem to be able to put two [good] games together\,\" said 
 Robinson. \"It seems like we don't have the ability to do it.\"\n\nHerna
 ndez was solid for seven of his eight innings\, but it was the fourth th
 at proved to be his undoing. With one out\, Andruw Jones hit his 47th ho
 me run of the season over the right-field fence. The home run tied the B
 raves' single-season mark\, which is held by Hall of Famers Eddie Mathew
 s and Hank Aaron.\n\nEntering Saturday's action\, Jones was hitting .295
  with five home runs and 19 RBIs against Washington this season. Both th
 e home runs and RBIs are the most given up by any team.\n\n\"We just nee
 d to be smart enough to know which players we need to pitch around\,\" s
 aid Jose Guillen\, who wondered aloud why Jones wasn't walked intentiona
 lly. \"You can't make a good pitch to hit to Andruw or Chipper [Jones]. 
 Everybody knows how hot those guys have been. There's no reason to pitch
  to them. Take a chance with the other guys. ... There's no reason to pi
 tch to Andruw\, especially the way he is swinging.\"\n\nFour batters lat
 er\, with runners on first and second and two outs\, Hernandez took his 
 chances on rookie catcher Brian McCann\, who hit Hernandez's 2-0 pitch o
 ver the right-field wall to give the Braves a 4-0 lead. It was McCann's 
 fifth home run of the season.\n\nIn retrospect\, Hernandez thought that 
 he should have walked McCann in order to load the bases and pitch to sta
 rting pitcher Jorge Sosa.\n\n\"I don't think nobody [saw that situation]
 \,\" said Hernandez. \"I don't know what happened. I made a mistake\, an
 d that was it.\"\n\nHernandez also thought that Jeff Francoeur\, who was
  on second base when the home run was hit\, may have tipped McCann on wh
 at pitch was coming. Hernandez said that he threw a slider inside\, but 
 he felt McCann should have been looking for a fastball\, which is normal
 ly what a pitcher throws when he is behind in the count.\n\n\"I didn't g
 et the sign from second base\,\" said McCann. \"I was looking for someth
 ing up in the zone. He threw me a cutter\, left it a little more over th
 e plate than he wanted to.\"\n\nRobinson believes that if McCann hadn't 
 hit the home run\, Sosa wouldn't have gone eight innings. He feels that 
 with a 1-0 lead\, Atlanta manager Bobby Cox would have gone to the bullp
 en\, which has been the team's weakest link this season.\n\n\"Sosa would
  not have been out there if it was a 1-0 game in the seventh inning\,\" 
 said Robinson. \"I'm not managing for Bobby Cox\, but I just know his [s
 trategy]. He goes to the bullpen in a close ballgame.\"\n\nBut with a 4-
 0 lead\, Sosa (11-3) went on to pitch eight scoreless frames\, giving up
  six hits\, striking out three batters and walking none. He threw 99 pit
 ches\, 74 of them for strikes.\n\n\"We didn't get his pitch count up\,\"
  said outfielder Ryan Church\, who went 2-for-3. \"It seems like we were
  in the batter's box\, and one or two pitches later\, we were out of the
 re. He gave up a single here [and there]\, but that was about it.\"\n\nT
 he Nationals' biggest chance to score came in the fifth inning. With Chu
 rch on first\, Cristian Guzman hit a deep fly to right field. The ball w
 as over the fence\, but Francoeur leaped and caught it for the first out
  of the inning.\n\n\"Francoeur turned the game around with that catch\,\
 " said Cox. \"He was playing Guzman fairly shallow. To make that kind of
  catch\, running the way he was\, that turned the ballgame around.\"\n\n
 Hernandez then sacrificed Church to second base\, but Brad Wilkerson pop
 ped up to end the inning.\n\n\"When we are down in the game\, we give ou
 rselves up\,\" said Guillen. \"We are always waiting for something to ha
 ppen to score. In this game\, we have to give 100 percent for nine innin
 gs.\"\n\nDespite the loss and inconsistency in the second half of the se
 ason\, Wilkerson still believes the Nationals have a chance to make the 
 playoffs.\n\n\"I wouldn't say we are not going to make the playoffs just
  yet\,\" said Wilkerson. \"We still have a lot of games to play\, but we
  need to start playing day in and day out -- playing consistent on the f
 ield.\"\n\n\nThis story was not subject to the approval of Major League

SUMMARY:(L) @ Atlanta
DESCRIPTION:Loss: 2-3\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nATLANTA -- Since th
 e All-Star break\, the Nationals' offense has been blamed for the team's
  recent slide\, but on Tuesday it was the bullpen that didn't get the jo
 b done\, as Andruw Jones' bases-loaded walk in the bottom of the 10th in
 ning helped the Braves edge the Nationals\, 3-2\, in front of 43\,308 at
  Turner Field.\nIt all started in the ninth inning. The Nationals had a 
 2-1 lead\, but closer Chad Cordero had problems getting hitters out. And
 ruw Jones led off with a double\, and Chipper Jones followed with a sing
 le to center to put runners on first and third.\n\nThe next hitter\, Ada
 m LaRoche\, hit a sacrifice fly to right field to drive in Andruw Jones 
 and tie the score at two.\n\nIt was Cordero's fourth blown save of the s
 eason. He was not available for comment after the game.\n\n\"We had enou
 gh runs on the board to win tonight. All we had to do was get three outs
 \, and we didn't do it tonight. You have to win some of those games like
  that\,\" said manager Frank Robinson.\n\nIt would get worse for the Nat
 ionals in the 10th inning. Mike Stanton started the frame by giving up a
  leadoff single to Brian McCann\, then it looked as if the Nationals wou
 ld get out of the inning. After Julio Franco sacrificed McCann to second
  and Rafael Furcal was walked intentionally to put runners on first and 
 second\, Stanton was able to get Kelly Johnson to pop up for the second 
 out.\n\nRobinson then took Stanton out of the game in favor of Luis Ayal
 a\, who had a tough time finding the plate.\n\nOn a 1-1 pitch\, Ayala hi
 t Marcus Giles to load the bases. Andruw Jones was the next hitter\, and
  he walked on four straight pitches to force home pinch-runner Jeff Fran
 coeur.\n\nThe losing pitcher was Stanton\, while Chris Reitsma took the 
 victory.\n\n\"It's a tough one because of the situation. Chad has pitche
 d so incredibly well this year\,\" said Stanton. \"They put it in our ha
 nds\, and we were not able to get the job done.\"\n\nAfter the final pit
 ch of the game\, Ayala and catcher Brian Schneider argued with home plat
 e umpire Bruce Dreckman for a couple of seconds\, saying that ball four 
 was actually a strike. But the replay showed that Dreckman made the righ
 t call\, as the ball was on the outside part of the plate.\n\nRobinson e
 ven questioned what Ayala was trying to do on the 3-0 pitch.\n\n\"It was
 n't a very good outing for Ayala\,\" he said. \"He hit a batter\, and wh
 en you go 3-0\, you don't have much of a chance\, and then you throw a m
 arginal pitch on 3-0. That's not very good.\n\n\"You throw the ball at t
 he middle of the plate. Do you think Jones is swinging on 3-0? No. If he
  is\, let him swing the bat. [Ayala] tried to make a perfect pitch -- ou
 tside corner.\"\n\nThe Nationals have lost seven of their last 10 games 
 since the All-Star break. After spending 51 consecutive days in first pl
 ace\, they now find themselves a game behind the Braves in the National 
 League East\, though they lead the Wild Card race by two games over the 
 Astros.\n\nStanton\, a veteran of postseason play\, said that it's too e
 arly for the Nationals to think that they must beat the Braves in this t
 hree-game series.\n\n\"Obviously\, you would like to win them\, especial
 ly against the teams you are battling with\, but it's still the end of J
 uly with 60 some-odd games to go\,\" he said.\n\nIt looked as though Liv
 an Hernandez's 10-game losing streak against the Braves was going to com
 e to an end. The last time he defeated the Braves during the regular sea
 son was on Aug. 18\, 2000\, when he was a member of the Giants.\n\nHerna
 ndez pitched eight innings and allowed one run on five hits. He struck o
 ut five batters and walked only one.\n\nRobinson was questioned as to wh
 y Hernandez didn't pitch the ninth inning. Robinson's explanation was th
 at it was hot on the field and that Hernandez was still experiencing pro
 blems with his right knee.\n\n\"Livan gave us a tremendous eight innings
 \, but we couldn't close the deal. We couldn't ask him to do any more\,\
 " said Robinson.\n\nHernandez's counterpart\, John Smoltz\, was just as 
 effective. He pitched eight innings and gave up two runs on four hits. H
 e struck out four and walked two.\n\nThe Nationals took a 1-0 lead again
 st Smoltz in the third inning\, when Brad Wilkerson drove in Brian Schne
 ider with a single to right.\n\nTwo innings later\, Jose Guillen singled
  up the middle to drive in Hernandez to give the Nationals a 2-0 lead.\n
 \nThe Braves cut the lead in half in the bottom of the seventh inning\, 
 when LaRoche took Hernandez's first pitch and homered over the right-fie
 ld wall.\n\n\"I threw a slider inside. He was cheating and got right the
 re in the zone\,\" said Hernandez.\n\n\nThis story was not subject to th

 n a 10-game winning streak as they edged the Mariners\, 3-2\, in front o
 f 37\,170 at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium on Sunday afternoon.\nThe streak 
 ties the Yankees for the longest of the season. The Yankees won 10 in a 
 row from May 7-17.\n\nIt was timely hitting that helped the Nationals pu
 ll off another victory. In the second inning\, with Nick Johnson on thir
 d base and Mariners right-hander Ryan Franklin on the mound\, Junior Spi
 vey took the first pitch and hit a two-run home run over the left-field 
 fence\, giving the Nationals a 2-0 lead.\n\nIt was Spivey's sixth home r
 un of the season\, but his first since the Nationals acquired him from t
 he Brewers for right-hander Tomo Ohka last Friday.\n\n\"It was a first-p
 itch fastball that was down and in. I wasn't particularly looking for th
 at pitch in that situation\, Spivey said. \"The infield was coming in an
 d I was looking for a pitch that was up. I was able to get my bat head o
 n it. The ball felt good off the bat. I didn't know if it was a home run
 . It's a big ballpark.\"\n\nIn the fourth inning\, with Franklin still o
 n the mound\, Jamey Carroll singled over the head of shortstop Mike Mors
 e to drive in Vinny Castilla and give the Nationals a 3-0 lead.\n\nCarro
 ll credited manager Frank Robinson for putting infielder Tony Blanco in 
 the on-deck circle instead pitcher Tony Armas Jr. Carroll felt the move 
 forced Franklin to throw fastballs instead of throwing breaking balls.\n
 \n\"Whether Blanco was going to pinch-hit\, I don't know\, but it gave F
 ranklin an opportunity to pitch to me instead of throwing me off-speed p
 itches\,\" Carroll said. \"It gave me a chance to get a fastball. I got 
 enough on it to hit it in the right spot and get the run to score. Fortu
 nately\, we held on and it was a big RBI.\"\n\nArmas pitched five shutou
 t innings to earned his second consecutive decision. He threw 107 pitche
 s and 70 of them went for strikes. Armas threw a lot of pitches because 
 Jeremy Reed and Raul Ibanez battled him throughout the game. Armas threw
  over 45 pitches combined against the two hitters. Reed and Ibanez went 
 a combined 2-for-7 in the game.\n\nRobinson didn't think Armas would pit
 ch five innings. He already had 80 pitches by the third.\n\n\"Armas real
 ly battled through five innings. He had to work out some jams almost eve
 ry inning. But he was the glue that held us together\,\" Robinson said.\
 n\n\"There were a lot of foul balls\, but I didn't let it bother me\,\" 
 Armas said.\n\nReliever Gary Majewski replaced Armas in the sixth inning
  and gave up two runs in 1 2/3 innings. But Luis Ayala and Chad Cordero 
 shut out the Mariners the rest of the way\, with Cordero picking up his

 ey finish the homestand 12-1\, having won 13 out of their last 14 games\
 , placing them a season-high 11 games over .500 at 37-26. The last time 
 the organization won 10 games in a row was June 6-16\, 1997\, when they 
 were the Expos.\n\nAfter the game\, the fans showed their appreciation b

  33 games. It established a new record for a Washington-based Major Leag

 ).\n\n\"The fans are really responding to us because of the way we are p
 laying on the field\,\" Robinson said.\n\nOutfielder Jose Guillen said t

 urprise opposing teams.\n\n\"It's a long season and we play in a tough d

  are a good team.\"\n\nThe Nationals now go on a nine-game road trip sta

 do not play their best ball under Robinson. In fact\, the organization i
 s 110-130 under Robinson on the road the last three-plus seasons.\n\n\"W
 e have to come ready to play. We have to play hard for nine innings. Ana
 heim is one of the best teams in baseball\,\" Brad Wilkerson said. \"If 
 we do the little things like we have been doing\, I think we can beat an

DESCRIPTION:Loss: 2-3\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- Natio
 nals manager Frank Robinson did something to Ryan Drese that surprised t
 he right-hander against the Padres on Saturday night.\nThe game was tied
  at 2 when Robinson decided to take Drese out of the game in favor of le
 fty Joey Eischen. At the time Robinson took Drese out of the game\, the 
 left-handed hitting Dave Roberts had a 2-2 count and Eric Young was on s
 econd base as the potential go-ahead run.\n\nThe TV cameras showed Drese
 ' dismay when he entered the dugout. It wasn't like Drese was pitching p
 oorly. In fact\, he had a quality outing. Drese had given up two runs ov
 er six innings when Robinson went to the bullpen.\n\n\"I was very surpri
 sed. It has never happened before\, but there is nothing I could do abou
 t it\,\" Drese said. \"There was no reason given whatsoever. I don't kno
 w. Of course\, I wanted to stay in the game. I thought I was going to ge
 t Roberts out there and had Joe Randa [on deck]\, who I handled all nigh
 t.\"\n\nThe change Robinson made backfired. Eischen managed to strike ou
 t Roberts\, but he gave up an RBI double to Randa\, scoring Young on the
  play to give the Padres a 3-2 lead that they would make stand for the f
 inal score in front of 38\,076 at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium. The run was
  charged to Drese. Randa had gone 0-for-3 against Drese in the game.\n\n
 \"The way runs are scarce around here\, it really upset me\,\" Eischen s
 aid. \"I knew I needed to come in and leave Young on second and the game
  at 2-2. I didn't leave it that way and I put our team at a disadvantage
 . It [stinks].\"\n\nAsked why he took Drese out of the game\, Robinson s
 aid\, \"It's not like that I didn't think he could get out Dave Roberts.
  I just thought in that situation Eischen had a better shot at him. I fi
 gured Roberts would be bunting and he was. I wanted to see what happened
  with the bunt if I brought in the left-hander.\n\n\"I just didn't think
  that [Drese] was going to be able to do what was needed at that time an
 d that is to get Roberts out without the runner moving.\"\n\nThe winning
  pitcher was Pedro Astacio (1-2)\, while Drese (7-11) took the loss and 
 Trevor Hoffman picked up his 29th save of the season.\n\nThe loss came a
  few hours after the Nationals held a team meeting about getting their a
 ct together in the second half. The Nationals have lost 21 of their last
  29 games\, 13 consecutive games decided by one run\, dropping their rec
 ord to 58-52. They are now 5 1/2 games behind the Braves in the National
  League East and one game behind the Astros in the Wild Card race.\n\n\"
 Just because you have a meeting that doesn't mean you are going to go ou
 t and go on a tear\,\" Robinson said.\n\nThe Nationals' offense continue
 s to sputter. It collected only five hits\, four of them were against As
 tacio\, who pitched six solid innings and gave up two runs on four hits.
  He struck out four batters and walked three.\n\nThe Nationals were able
  to strike first against Astacio\, when Cristian Guzman scored on a Jose
  Vidro groundout in the third inning.\n\nBut the Padres tied the score a
 t 1 off Drese in the top of the fourth inning\, when Mark Loretta drove 
 in Robert Fick.\n\nThird baseman Vinny Castilla gave the Nationals a one
 -run lead again when he connected with Astacio's first pitch for a home 
 run over the left-center field wall in the bottom of the fourth inning.\
 n\nThe Padres responded in the fifth inning\, when Mark Sweeney hit a sa
 crifice fly to score Fick.\n\nThe Nationals collected only two hits afte
 r Castilla's home run. Asked if changes should be made to the offense\, 
 Vidro said\, \"I have a lot of confidence in the guys that played in the
  ballgame. We also have to realize that there are a lot of guys who are 
 playing hurt. I just think we have to shake it up and not make excuses. 
 Our pitching staff is doing a great job. They give us a chance to win ev
 ery ballgame. On offense\, we have to find a way to get things going.\"\

 HEIM -- Under manager Frank Robinson\, the Expos/Nationals have always h
 ad problems winning games on the road\, and Monday was no different as t
 he Nationals were pounded by the Angels\, 11-1\, in front of 40\,790 at 
 Angel Stadium of Anaheim.\nThe loss breaks the Nationals' 10-game winnin
 g streak\; however\, they are still in first-place in the National Leagu
 e East and are one game ahead of the Phillies.\n\nIt was a night when Na
 tionals outfielder Jose Guillen made his first appearance at Angel Stadi
 um since the Angels suspended him for the last week of the 2004 season a
 nd the postseason because of inappropriate conduct following his removal
  for a pinch-runner on Sept. 25 against the A's.\n\nGuillen went 1-for-4
  in the game and heard a round of boos every time he stepped up to the p
 late or caught a fly ball in right field.\n\n\"I don't think they should
  boo me. I didn't do anything to the fans here\,\" Guillen said. \"I'm j
 ust here to play baseball. Whatever the fans do\, I don't really care.\"
 \n\nBut it was Guillen's former teammate\, Vladimir Guerrero\, who stole
  the show. Guerrero went 4-for-4 with five RBIs. He had RBI singles agai
 nst right-handers Esteban Loaiza and Sun-woo Kim and a three-run home ru
 n against right-hander T.J. Tucker.\n\nIt was the first time Guerrero ha
 s played against the Nationals since becoming a free agent after the 200
 3 season. He had eight great years in an Expos uniform.\n\n\"That guy ca
 n hit anything\, whether it's outside\, over his head\, anywhere\,\" Gui
 llen said. \"Just walk him. That's the best way to make sure that he doe
 sn't hit any balls. He's amazing. If he's not the best [player]\, then h
 e' is in the top two.\"\n\nOutfielder Brad Wilkerson played with Guerrer
 o for two-plus seasons in Montreal\, and Wilkerson knows first-hand the 
 damage Guerrero can cause in a game.\n\n\"If you put guys on base with h
 im up at the plate\, it's going to be a rough night\,\" Wilkerson said. 
 \"We just have to do a better job of keeping the guys off bases in front
  of him and make him hit with nobody on. It's not just him\, they have g
 uys in the lineup that can hurt you.\"\n\nThe Nationals had a chance to 
 set the tone early in the game against Angels starter Paul Byrd\, but co
 uldn't take advantage of the situation. In the first inning\, Wilkerson 
 led off with a double to right-center field\, But Ryan Church flied out 
 to center field\, Guillen struck out looking and Nick Johnson grounded o
 ut to Byrd to end the inning.\n\nIt went downhill after that.\n\nLoaiza 
 was the Nationals' starter and he didn't get past the fourth inning. He 
 lasted three-plus innings and gave up five runs on five hits. It didn't 
 help that he pitched with a stiff neck and a sore back. Loaiza has had t
 he injury for the last three days.\n\n\"I received some treatment after 
 the game. Hopefully\, it's nothing serious. I have to prepare for my nex
 t outing\,\" Loaiza said.\n\nLoaiza couldn't get anybody out in the four
 th and in came Kim\, who gave up two runs in two innings.\n\nTucker ente
 red the game in the sixth and didn't fare any better than Loaiza and Kim
 . Tucker gave up four runs in three innings.\n\nThe Nationals' hitters w
 ere stifled against Byrd. He pitched six solid innings and gave up the o
 ne run on four hits. The run came on a Guillen single in the top of the 
 sixth inning\, scoring Wilkerson.\n\n\"We didn't take advantage of our f
 irst inning to jump on top. The Angels turned it around. They swung the 
 bats well all night\,\" Wilkerson said.\n\nThe Nationals have lost 11 of
  their last 14 games on the road. Still\, Robinson and Wilkerson believe
  this team is a much better club than it was the last three seasons and 
 should not be judged based on its past reputation.\n\n\"We are not the s
 ame team. Why would you compare this one to the ones that played the las
 t three years? Those teams would not be where we are right now\,\" Robin
 son said.\n\nSaid Wilkerson\, \"It's tough to play on the road. It's not
  easy. This is a different ballclub. In my opinion\, the Angels are one 
 of the top three or four ball clubs in the Major Leagues. We just have t
 o come ready to play tomorrow and take advantage of our opportunities an

 nd of Day was it for the Nationals on Monday night? It was a bad one as 
 they were pounded by the Braves\, 11-2\, in front of 16\,584 at Turner F
 ield.\n\nNationals right-hander Zach Day (0-1) didn't get past the fifth
  inning\, giving up seven runs on nine hits in 4 1/3 innings.\n\n\"He wa
 s out of the strike zone and then when he came in the strike zone\, he d
 idn't make very good pitches. His location was terrible\,\" manager Fran
 k Robinson said.\n\nDay usually finds himself in trouble in the early in
 nings of a ballgame and Monday was no different. He gave up a two-run do
 uble to Adam La Roche in the first inning to make it 2-0.\n\nThe Braves 
 managed to go quietly in the second and third innings\, but Day gave up 
 an RBI double to Raul Modesi in the fourth and two two-run home runs to 
 Rafael Furcal and Andrew Jones in the fifth.\n\n\"I didn't get the job d
 one. The ball was up. Overall\, I felt good\,\" Day said.\n\nRobinson sa
 id Day wasn't the only one who had a bad outing on Monday. The skipper f
 elt that Joey Eischen\, T.J. Tucker and Joe Horgan were not good on the 
 mound. They often found themselves behind the hitter too many times.\n\n
 Eischen and Tucker didn't give up any runs\, while Horgan gave up four i
 n the bottom of the ninth inning.\n\n\"It was Zach Day to Eischen to Tuc
 ker to Horgan. I didn't see anybody out there on the mound that had a go
 od night and that's not good\,\" Robinson said. \"I can put up getting y
 our brains getting beat out\, but I can't put up with ball one\, ball tw
 o\, ball three\, strike one\, strike two\, walk and then bang. I can't p
 ut up with that kind of stuff. We were behind the hitters. ... We made t
 he Braves look like world-beaters. The pitching was terrible.\"\n\nDay's
  inconsistency on the mound has prompted the Nationals to rethink their 
 position of putting Day in the bullpen once Tony Armas Jr. is activated 
 from the disabled list. Some in the organization feel he hasn't been the
  same pitcher since he hurt his shoulder in a collision with Wil Cordero
  in May of 2003. Day missed almost two months with an inflamed shoulder.
 \n\nDay's possible demotion could mean that John Patterson would remain 
 in the rotation.\n\nBraves starter Mike Hampton (1-0) was the antithesis
  of Day. Hampton pitched eight solid innings\, while giving up one run o
 n seven hits. Hampton struck out only one batter\, but walked none.\n\nT
 he one run was scored in the top of the seventh inning\, when Jose Guill
 en hit his third home run of the season. The run snapped a 15-inning sco
 reless streak for the Nationals.\n\n\"I saw something different today\,\
 " Jose Vidro said. \"[Hampton] has a history of getting wild\, but it di
 dn't happen. He was very aggressive. He threw more fastballs early in th
 e count. The Braves scored a couple of runs early for him and he took co
 ntrol of the game.\"\n\nHampton also helped himself with the bat\, by go
 ing 2-for-4 with two runs scored.\n\nThe Braves scored their final four 
 runs in the ninth off Horgan\, who had a tough time getting people out. 
 The left-hander gave up an RBI double to Furcal\, walked Chipper Jones w
 ith the bases loaded to force in a run\, gave up a sacrifice fly to Andr
 ew Jones and an RBI single to La Roche.\n\nThe Nationals scored the fina
 l run of the game in the ninth inning when J.J. Davis drove in a run wit
 h a single off Kevin Gryboski.\n\nThe Nationals have scored four runs in
  their last four games\, which has Robinson very concerned. They haven't
  scored two or more runs in a game since the fifth inning of Saturday's 
 game when Ryan Church and Vinny Castilla hit consecutive home runs again
 st the Marlins.\n\n\"We can't depend on home runs. We have to put hits t
 ogether and we are not doing that at all\,\" Robinson said. \"Most of th
 e time\, if we get something started\, it's two outs. We are not getting
  the big hits. You don't get the big hits until you are in a good groove
 .\"\n\nThe Nationals have now lost three of their last four games and dr

DESCRIPTION:Win: 2-0\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- If one
  looked at manager Frank Robinson's starting nine Thursday afternoon\, a
  lineup that featured rookies Ryan Zimmerman\, Rick Short and Brandon Wa
 tson\, one would have thought that Robinson was waving the white flag an
 d admitting that that there was no chance for the Nationals to reach the
  playoffs.\nWith nine games to play\, the Nationals are six games behind
  the Astros with the tragic number for elimination at four. But the sign
 ificant deficit had nothing to do with Robinson's benching of his entire
  starting lineup.\n\n\"I'm giving the regulars a day off and try somethi
 ng a little different\,\" Robinson said. \"I want to give the bench play
 ers a shot and see what they can do. Maybe they can bring a little more 
 energy to the field and maybe win us a ballgame today.\"\n\nThe lineup c
 hanges worked. Run-scoring hits by Short and Deivi Cruz helped the Natio
 nals defeat the Giants\, 2-0\, in front of 29\,807 at Robert F. Kennedy 
 Stadium.\n\nThe victory broke the Nationals' four-game losing streak and
  helped them salvage the three-game series.\n\n\"If it wasn't for the yo
 ung guys\, we would still be playing\,\" Robinson said. \"I liked what I
  saw. Zimmerman continues to impress. Short continues to show how he can
  make contact. He has some pop in his bat to all fields.\"\n\nThere was 
 no score in the seventh when the Nationals scored two runs in the bottom
  of the inning off starter Brett Tomko.\n\nWith one out\, Short doubled 
 to right-center field to score Zimmerman all the way from first base to 
 give the Nationals a 1-0 lead.\n\nShort\, who won the Pacific Coast Leag
 ue and Minor League batting title\, went 2-for-3 in the game to raise hi
 s batting average to .462. Prior to the game\, Short was concerned that 
 his timing would be off\, since he didn't swing a bat in eight days.\n\n
 \"After the first at-bat\, I made a few adjustments. I played the game a
 nd had fun. I play the game hard\, and we ended up winning the game\,\" 
 Short said.\n\nHitting has never been an issue with Short\, but his defe
 nse has kept him in the Minor Leagues for 11-plus seasons before making 
 his Major League debut June 10 against the Mariners. In fact\, the Natio
 nals have already told Short that he needs to work on his defense this w
 inter.\n\n\"They want to have confidence to throw me out there at a coup
 le of different positions\,\" Short said. \"We are going to work on the 
 defense and work on the confidence. All I can do is work on the things t
 hey tell me to work on. We'll see what it holds for next year.\"\n\nThe 
 Nationals scored the second run of the game in the seventh\, when Cruz f
 ollowed Short with a single up the middle to score Short.\n\nThe winning
  pitcher was Jon Rauch\, while Tomko took the loss and Chad Cordero pick
 ed up his 47th save of the season.\n\nRight-hander Hector Carrasco\, who
  has spent most of the season as a very effective reliever\, made his th
 ird consecutive start and shut out the Giants for 5 2/3 innings. He stru
 ck out a career-high eight batters and walked four.\n\nIn the role as a 
 starter\, he has given up two runs in 15 2/3 innings (1.15 ERA) and stru
 ck out 17 batters. Carrasco has taken a liking to his new role and would
  like to be strictly a starter next season.\n\n\"I can be both a starter
  and a reliever\, but for next year\, I would like to be a starter becau
 se I know I can do it. I can go a long way [in the game]. I don't know w
 hat's going to happen next year\,\" Carrasco said. \"I'm not afraid to c
 ome out there every day [as a reliever]. Now I'm a starter and it's even
  better.\"\n\nRobinson foresees Carrasco in both roles.\n\n\"You have a 
 switch-hitter in the pitching department\,\" Robinson said. \"You know h
 e did a terrific job out of the bullpen\, and\, in three starts\, when t
 hings were on the line\, he has been outstanding as a starter. The need 
 next year will determine where he is going to be. He fits in both roles 
 right now.\"\n\nCarrasco credits his success this season to his changeup
 \, which was taught to him by Nationals pitching coach Randy St. Claire.
 \n\n\"I appreciate what he has tried to do with me with his changeup. It
  has helped me a lot\,\" Carrasco said. \"Last year\, I threw a changeup
  and it wasn't so good. This year I've been working with Randy St. Clair
 e. When we are playing catch\, he tells me to stay on top of the changeu

SUMMARY:(L) vs Mets
DESCRIPTION:Loss: 5-6\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- On Ju
 ly 3\, the Nationals became the third team to win 50 games in 2005. Ever
 ybody in the organization was talking about the possibility of going to 
 the playoffs\, and interim general manager Jon Bowden often talked about
  Frank Robinson winning the Manager of the Year Award.\nFast-forward to 
 Sunday\, Sept. 25. Two days after being eliminated from the National Lea
 gue East race\, the Nationals find themselves in fifth place in the divi
 sion\, on a three-game losing streak and eliminated from the Wild Card r
 ace after the Mets used the long ball to win\, 6-5\, in front of 29\,967
  at RFK Stadium and sweep the three-game series.\n\nNow everybody is pri
 vately talking about making significant changes to the 25-man roster. Fo
 r example\, there has been talk of trading third baseman Vinny Castilla 
 during the offseason to make room for 20-year-old phenom Ryan Zimmerman.
 \n\n\"This team doesn't want -- nor need -- to finish in last place with
  the season that we've had\,\" said Brad Wilkerson. \"It's going to come
  up short of what we wanted to do\, but finishing in last place will put
  a bad taste in our mouths. We need to regroup and set some goals for ou
 rselves to get out of last place.\"\n\nSunday's loss has the Nationals a
 t 26-42 after the All-Star break. Wilkerson has his theories on what wen
 t wrong.\n\n\"It was a combination of a lot of things\,\" he said. \"I f
 elt like we were not hitting the ball as good as we wanted to at the beg
 inning of the second half. Late in the season\, our bullpen wore down a 
 little. We lost some key close games. We won the one-run games in the fi
 rst half\, and in the second half\, it completely turned around.\"\n\nOn
  Sunday\, the Nationals had a 5-4 lead going into the top of the eighth 
 inning\, but reliever Travis Hughes couldn't keep the ball in the park.\
 n\nWith one out\, David Wright hit a 1-2 pitch over the left-field wall 
 to tie the score at 5. Two batters later\, Mike Jacobs hit a solo home r
 un over the right-field wall to give the Mets the 6-5 lead.\n\nDuring th
 e second half of the season\, opposing hitters have hit 43 home runs whi
 le the Nationals have hit 18. This disproves the theory held by some of 
 the Nationals that RFK is a pitchers' park.\n\nSome players\, such as Jo
 se Guillen and Castilla\, have complained that they have been robbed of 
 home runs because of the stadium's huge dimensions.\n\n\"There was some 
 grumblings about the park early in the season\, which at the time\, I di
 dn't understand\, because we were successful at RFK\,\" said catcher Gar
 y Bennett. \"We had one of the best records here\, so who cares whether 
 we are hitting home runs or not?\"\n\n\"I'll tell you one thing\, I'll b
 e glad to get out of this band box\,\" joked Robinson after the game. \"
 The pitchers are not throwing the ball the way they are supposed to thro
 w it. They are throwing it to the hitters' strengths. They are not hitti
 ng their spots to get hitters out.\"\n\nThe winning pitcher on Sunday wa
 s Juan Padilla\, while Hughes took the loss and Aaron Heilman picked up 
 his third save of the season.\n\nNationals starter John Patterson didn't
  have one of his best outings. He lasted six innings\, and gave up four 
 runs on four hits. He acknowledged that he was thinking about his parent
 s\, brother and sister\, who were in Jasper\, Texas\, when Hurricane Rit
 a struck.\n\nPatterson is happy to report that his family is safe in Hou
 ston\, but they still don't know if their homes in Orange were damaged.\
 n\n\"[My family] was on my mind\,\" said Patterson. \"I was trying to do
  the best job that I could under the circumstances.\"\n\nThe Nationals g
 ave Patterson a 3-1 lead after three innings\, but he couldn't hold it.\
 n\nIn the top of the fourth\, with one out and Cliff Floyd on first\, Mi
 ke Piazza hit his second home run of the game to tie the score at 3.\n\n
 \"We just stayed away\, and he just hit a pretty good pitch and drove it
  out of center field\,\" said Patterson.\n\nThe Mets took the lead in th
 e sixth inning\, when Wright doubled down the left-field line to score C
 arlos Beltran.\n\nBut the Nationals came back to regain the lead in the 
 seventh. With the bases loaded and Padilla on the mound\, Nick Johnson s
 ingled up the middle to score Brandon Watson and Junior Spivey. Wilkerso
 n tried to score on the play after the ball went past Wright at third ba
 se\, but Wright managed to quickly pick up the ball and throw out Wilker
 son at the plate.\n\n\"One more hop and I might get in there safely\,\" 
 said Wilkerson. \"As soon as I saw Wright pick up the ball\, I felt he h
 ad to make a bad throw. He made a pretty high throw. He went up and got 
 it\, and Piazza put a pretty good tag on me pretty quick.\"\n\nThe runs 
 that did score on the play were changed to Mets starter Kris Benson.\n\n

 \n\nOn Saturday\, Patterson picked up his seventh loss\, as Ryan Howard 
 and Chase Utley drove in a combined seven runs as the Phillies pounded t
 he Nationals\, 8-4\, in front of 32\,903 at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium.\n
 \nPatterson had one of his toughest outings of the season. He lasted 5 2
 /3 innings and gave up seven runs on seven hits.\n\nThe Phillies\, who n
 eeded to win the game to stay alive in the National League Wild Card rac
 e\, went to work on Patterson in the first inning by scoring four runs. 
 Howard highlighted the scoring with a three-run double.\n\nRight-hander 
 Brett Meyers was the starter for the Phillies\, and he proved to be too 
 much for the Nationals. He lasted 6 2/3 innings and gave up three runs o
 n six hits.\n\nThe Nationals had a tough time hitting Myers' curveball\,
  so the game plan was to hit the first fastball they saw\, but it didn't
  work. Myers struck out a career-high 12\, while four Phillies relievers
  combined to strike out five more.\n\n\"Myers had his curveball tonight\
 ,\" catcher Gary Bennett said. \"It was one [heck] of a pitch\, plus he 
 was throwing a 90-to-93 [mph] fastball and locating it. It's not easy.\"
 \n\nThe Nationals made it a 4-2 game by the second inning. In the first\
 , Marlon Byrd scored on a Nick Johnson groundout. An inning later\, Ryan
  Church led off with a solo home run. It was Church's eighth homer of th
 e season and his first since June 18.\n\nBut the Phillies put the game a
 way by the seventh. In the fifth\, with Patterson on the mound\, Utley h
 it a two-run home run\, then Howard led off and hit a solo shot into the
  upper deck in right field off Patterson the next inning.\n\nBennett sai
 d he is impressed by the way his former team has put it together during 
 the pennant race. The Phillies need to win on Sunday and hope that the A
 stros lose to force a one-game playoff.\n\n\"The Phillies are playing we
 ll right now\,\" Bennett said. \"They started off slowly\, and in the se
 cond half\, they have put it together. Utley and Howard have stepped it 
 up big for them. Those guys have plugged some holes for them. They also 
 have Bobby [Abreu] and [Pat] Burrell. They have four guys in the middle 
 of the lineup\, and you have Jimmy [Rollins] and Kenny Lofton at the top
  of the order to create some havoc on the base paths.\"\n\nAfter Patters
 on managed to get two outs in the sixth\, manager Frank Robinson came ou
 t of the dugout to make a pitching change. Patterson was reluctant to gi
 ve his skipper the ball. But a couple of seconds later\, Patterson gave 
 in and left to a nice ovation.\n\n\"I wanted to go a little bit more int
 o that game\, but my pitch count was up there and the Phillies opened up
  a big lead\, and I could understand it\,\" Patterson said.\n\nIn his la
 st three starts\, Patterson gave up 16 runs in 18 2/3 innings.\n\n\"I di
 dn't finish strong\,\" he said. \"That's all I can say about it. I'm mak
 ing my pitches. A lot of times\, I pitch guys the same way and they have
  started to make adjustments on me. There are some things I need to work
  on. I'm going to come back bigger\, stronger and smarter. You have to h
 ave the experience to make the adjustment. I never threw close to 200 in
 nings before. So until you throw 200 innings\, you don't really understa
 nd what you have to do.\"\n\nReliever Joey Eischen was on the mound in t
 he seventh when Utley hit his second homer of the day over the right-fie
 ld fence to make it an 8-2 game.\n\nThe Nationals would add two more run
 s by the eighth inning on RBIs by Church and Brandon Watson before close
 r Billy Wagner struck out the side to end the game.\n\nThe Nationals' re
 cord fell to 81-80\, and they need to win Sunday's season finale to fini
 sh with a winning record.\n\nAsked if having a winning record gives his 
 club extra incentive on Sunday\, Robinson said\, \"It doesn't add any ex
 tra [incentive]. It's a baseball game and I go out to win all the baseba
 ll games that I play. I want to win on Sunday. We'll go out and approach
  it that way.\"\n\nThis story was not subject to the approval of Major L

DESCRIPTION:Loss: 7-8\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nATLANTA -- The Nati
 onals came back from a 7-1 deficit to tie the score and force extra inni
 ngs\, but Andruw Jones' solo home run in the 10th inning lifted Atlanta 
 past Washington\, 8-7\, in front of 19\,053 fans at Turner Field on Thur
 sday night.\nThe Nationals and Braves ended up splitting the four-game s
 eries. The Nationals are now seven games behind the Braves in the Nation
 al League East and three games behind the Phillies in the Wild Card race
 .\n\nReliever Luis Ayala was making his first appearance in more than a 
 week because of tendinitis in his right elbow flexor\, and Jones took a 
 1-2 pitch from Ayala and hit the ball over the wall in left-center field
  to give the Braves the walk-off victory.\n\nAccording to catcher Brian 
 Schneider\, Ayala's arm was sound. In fact\, Ayala's fastball was clocke
 d at 94 mph.\n\n\"He just missed the location. It was his first day back
  in a while\,\" Schneider said. \"Hopefully\, he doesn't think about thi
 s too much\, because we need him the next week or two.\"\n\nBut it wasn'
 t Ayala that cost the Nationals the game. It was baserunning blunders in
  the fourth and fifth innings that proved to be the turning points of th
 e game.\n\nWith John Smoltz on the mound in the fourth inning\, pitching
  with a six-run lead\, Vinny Castilla drove in two runs with a single to
  left to make it a 7-3 game.\n\nSchneider was the next hitter and he hit
  a fly ball to deep center field. Jones was able to make the catch and m
 anaged to double Castilla off first base. Castilla thought Schneider had
  hit a double in the gap. By the time Jones caught the ball\, Castilla w
 as already past second base.\n\n\"I don't need an explanation\,\" Nation
 als manager Frank Robinson said. \"I don't want to hear it. There is no 
 excuse for that.\"\n\nIn the next inning\, the Nationals had runners on 
 first and second and one out\, when Deivi Cruz\, making his Nationals de
 but\, hit a bloop single to short right field. Marlon Byrd was held at t
 hird base\, but Carlos Baerga\, thinking that Byrd was going to score\, 
 was caught in a rundown and was tagged out.\n\n\"Byrd didn't read the ba
 ll off the bat as he should have\, and that's why he was held up\,\" Rob
 inson said. \"And if you are behind the runner\, you can't take for gran
 ted that's he going to score. You have to run with your head up and watc
 h what happens.\"\n\nSaid Baerga\, \"I thought the ball was going to go 
 farther away. When I looked up\, Marlon was right at third base. It was 
 bad baserunning on my part.\"\n\nOn the surface\, it would like the firs
 t-base coach Don Buford and third-base coach Dave Huppert would be blame
 d for the blunders\, respectively. But Robinson blamed the runners thems
 elves in both instances.\n\n\"We should have won the game in regulation.
  We beat ourselves\,\" Robinson said. \"We have been preaching to the gu
 ys to take care of business. If you keep making these silly mistakes\, t
 hey come back to haunt you in close ballgames that you should win.\"\n\n
 In the seventh\, the Nationals scored four runs against three relievers\
 , all with two outs. Jim Brower started the inning and walked Jose Guill
 en with the bases loaded to force home Marlon Byrd to make it a 7-4 game
 .\n\nMacay McBride entered the game and walked Nick Johnson to force hom
 e Brad Wilkerson. Reliever Dan Kolb then came on and allowed a two-run s
 ingle to Castilla\, who drove in four runs in the game.\n\nThe Braves sc
 ored seven of their eight runs against right-hander Tony Armas Jr. He ha
 s given up 11 runs in his last seven innings.\n\nAsked about Armas' futu
 re in the rotation\, Robinson said\, \"I don't make those kind of decisi
 ons after a ballgame like this. I don't know what I'm going to do with A
 rmas right now. I'm going to sort out this ballgame here.\"\n\nThis stor

 by Abreu's double proved to be the difference as the Phillies edged the 
 Nationals\, 4-3\, in front of 33\,450 at Citizens Bank Park on Wednesday
  night.\nThe loss snapped the Nationals' four-game winning streak and pu
 t them 5 1/2 games behind the Braves in the National League East. The Na
 tionals also are a half-game behind the Phillies and Astros in the Wild 
 Card Race.\n\nThe game was tied at 2 when the Phillies scored two runs i
 n the bottom third inning off starter Esteban Loaiza.\n\nWith runners on
  second and third and one out\, Abreu doubled over the head of center fi
 elder Preston Wilson to score Jimmy Rollins and Kenny Lofton and give th
 e Phillies a 4-2 lead.\n\nLoaiza said he thought about walking Abreu int
 entionally to load the bases and face Pat Burrell. But Loaiza never rece
 ived the word from manager Frank Robinson to do so.\n\n\"I was trying to
  pitch around Abreu. I was thinking about getting an intentional walk\, 
 but it didn't come from Frank\, but you just never know\,\" Loaiza said.
  \"I was trying to get a ground ball. Frank took the positive mind of ha
 ving me face Abreu\, but he got that double with two RBIs.\"\n\nThe Nati
 onals had opportunities to at least tie the Phillies in the top of the s
 eventh with reliever Ryan Madson on the mound. With runners on second an
 d third and no outs\, the Nationals made it a one-run game when Vinny Ca
 stilla hit a sacrifice fly to drive in Wilson and put Brian Schneider at
  third base.\n\nRobinson then decided to have Carlos Baerga pinch-hit fo
 r Cristian Guzman. Baerga\, who was 4-for-9 as a pinch-hitter entering t
 he game\, popped up to David Bell at third base.\n\nBaerga felt his at-b
 at was the turning point of the game.\n\n\"I swung at a high pitch\, a b
 ad pitch\,\" Baerga said. \"I missed the second pitch that I fouled back
 . With the bad pitch\, I knew he wasn't going to throw me a fastball ins
 ide\, and I reacted to a bad ball. If I get a base hit\, I had an opport
 unity to get the run in. That was the game right there.\"\n\nRyan Church
  then came in as a pinch-hitter for reliever Luis Ayala and grounded out
  to end the inning.\n\n\"That's been kind of our bugaboo all year long\,
  trying to get that man in from third base with less than two outs\,\" R
 obinson said. \"We didn't do the job tonight. We ended up losing a one-r
 un ballgame. We have to come out [Thursday] and see what we can do.\"\n\
 nWith closer Billy Wagner on the mound in the ninth\, the Nationals got 
 off to a good start when Jose Guillen led off with a single. Preston Wil
 son was the next hitter and he battled Wagner for nine pitches\, but end
 ed up striking out on a slider.\n\n\"I was able to foul off some pitches
 \, but he threw a good breaking ball. It was in a great spot when it sta
 rted -- middle in -- and it ended up a little off the plate. It was down
  and in\,\" Wilson said. \"When you are battling\, the most you can hope
  for is to foul that pitch off.\"\n\nEven Wagner was impressed that Wils
 on battled him for 10 pitches.\n\n\"That was a great at-bat. It was impr
 essive\,\" Wagner said. \"I started laughing because I threw a pitch tha
 t I thought was going to hit him right in the [wrong place]. He hit it a
 nd I started laughing. Then he broke his bat\, and he came back and I th
 rew a slider.\n\n\"He wasn't catching up\, and he was pulling\, but [we]
  were jamming [Wilson inside]. After he broke his bat\, we said\, 'Let's
  take a chance [on the slider].'\"\n\nTony Blanco followed and was overp
 owered by Wagner's fastball. Blanco struck out on five pitches and Casti
 lla grounded out to end the game.\n\nThe winning pitcher was Jon Lieber 
 (12-10)\, while Loaiza (7-9) took the loss. Loaiza pitched 5 2/3 innings
  and gave up four runs on 10 hits.\n\nRelievers Joey Eischen\, Gary Maje
 wski and Ayala shut out the Phillies the rest of the way.\n\nRobinson fe
 lt Loaiza wasn't as sharp as he was in previous outings\, but said that 
 the righty kept the Nationals in the ballgame.\n\n\"The relief pitching

 t he put only four runs on the board. You can't say he didn't have it. H
 e wasn't as sharp and we had some opportunities to win the ballgame.\"\n
 \nThe Phillies took a 2-0 lead in the first inning. Chase Utley drove in
  Rollins on a sacrifice fly\, while Lofton came home on a double by Burr

DESCRIPTION:Win: 5-3\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- Earlie
 r this week\, the Nationals had concerns about Tomo Ohka. They believed 
 that he was hurt because his velocity was down\, and he was walking a lo
 t of batters. Ohka said he wasn't hurt and just had to fix some mechanic
 al problems.\n\nWhatever problems he had\, they were fixed on Saturday a
 s Ohka helped the Nationals defeat the Mets\, 5-3\, in a 7 1/2-inning af
 fair in front of 40\,913 at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium.\n\nZach Day had b
 een scheduled to pitch on Saturday\, but he was scratched because of an 
 inner ear infection. Ohka\, previously scheduled to pitch on Tuesday aga
 inst the Dodgers\, received the call about 4:00 p.m. ET and pitched six 
 shutout innings\, giving up only two hits while striking out three batte
 rs and walking one. Ohka (2-3) threw 89 pitches\, 57 of them strikes. He
  might have gone longer\, but heavy rains caused a 30-minute rain delay\
 , the first of two on the night\, after 5 1/2 innings.\n\nThe thing that
  the Nationals liked was that Ohka was working fast\, and his velocity w
 as back up in the low 90s.\n\n\"That is the way Ohka can pitch\, althoug
 h he didn't use the breaking balls as much as he normally does when he's
  in a good groove\,\" manager Frank Robinson said. \"He used his fastbal
 ls a lot today and pitched a good ballgame. This is what we have been lo
 oking for out of him. That was the Ohka I knew from the past.\"\n\nThe o
 nly time Ohka was in any kind of trouble was in the top of the fifth inn
 ing\, when Mets had the bases loaded with one out. Ohka struck out pinch
 -hitter Eric Valent and induced Jose Reyes to ground out to the mound to
  end the inning.\n\n\"That was good for him because he was tested tonigh
 t\, and he came through with flying colors under difficult circumstances
 \,\" Robinson said.\n\nOhka said long-toss and bullpen sessions helped h
 im get back to his old self.\n\n\"I threw hard\, but I'm not happy yet\,
 \" Ohka said.\n\nThe Nationals gave Ohka early run support when Vinny Ca
 stilla hit a two-run double in the first off of Mets starter Victor Zamb
 rano (1-3).\n\nIn the fourth inning\, Zambrano gave up a bases-loaded wa
 lk to Nick Johnson. Threatening skies insured Zambrano\, who went four i
 nnings\, giving up three runs on four hits\, would have a short night. M
 ets manager Willie Randolph had Eric Valent hit for Zambrano with the Me
 ts down three in the top of the fifth.\n\nReliever Manny Aybar then gave
  up solo home runs to Ryan Church and Johnson.\n\n\"You don't have to ge
 t a lot of hits all the time. It's when you get them. We got some timely
  hits and a couple of big home runs to add to it\,\" Robinson said. \"Vi
 nny is in the middle of it again\, and that's good to see.\"\n\nMets out
 fielder Cliff Floyd made it a 5-3 game in the top of the eighth inning\,
  driving a three-run double into right field off Gary Majewski.\n\nThat'
 s when things got out of hand. Robinson went on the field to take Majews
 ki out of the game and\, on the way to the mound\, asked home plate umpi
 re Tom Hallion about putting dirt on the many puddles on the infield. Ac
 cording to Robinson\, Hallion told him to ask crew chief Joe West.\n\n\"
 I said\, 'Since we are going to play this game\, you could cover the pud
 dle on the infield\,' and that's when [West] told me that nobody [had] s
 lipped yet.\"\n\nRobinson then went to Hallion again and made the same r
 equest\, which was denied. Robinson then uttered an expletive and was ej
 ected from the game. It was Robinson's first ejection since June 16\, 20
 04\, against the Twins. Robinson then played the game under protest.\n\n
 After the game\, West said the field was not unsuitable for play and tha
 t the umpires had done everything they could to make the sure the field 
 was safe for the players.\n\n\"The field was playable\,\" West said. \"T
 here was standing water\, yes\, but the field was playable\, and I asked
  every infielder when they went by me\, 'Is it all right? Everything OK?
  ... Did you slip? Did anything happen?' [They said\,] 'No\, no\, everyt
 hing's OK.' That's all we can do.\"\n\nNationals second baseman Jose Vid

 - It has been said many times that right-hander Zach Day needs to get ou
 t of the first two innings unscathed in order to be successful.\n\nDay d
 idn't get the job done as the Nationals lost to the Phillies\, 5-4\, in 
 front of 24\,956 at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium on Monday night.\n\nIt was
  in the second inning when the Phillies did their damage against Day. Wi
 th runners on first and third and one out\, David Bell hit a ground ball
  to third baseman Vinny Castilla who threw to second baseman Jose Vidro 
 for the force out\, but Vidro threw the ball past first baseman Nick Joh
 nson for an error. It allowed Jason Michaels to score the first run of t
 he game.\n\nAfter Mike Lieberthal was walked intentionally\, starter Cor
 y Lidle singled to right field to drive in Bell.\n\nIn the third\, the P
 hillies made it a 3-0 game when Chase Utley singled to left field to dri
 ve in Bobby Abreu.\n\nLidle was a little bit sharper than Day\, lasting 
 six innings and giving up three runs. Lidle kept Nationals off balance b
 y throwing a lot off-speed pitches.\n\n\"He threw a lot of curveballs to
 night\,\" outfielder Brad Wilkerson said. \"The last time I faced him\, 
 he wasn't throwing as many curveballs\, but we did a good job of battlin
 g.\n\nLidle even gave Day fits with the bat\, hitting the RBI single and
  drawing a walk. Day had so much difficulty with Lidle that manager Fran
 k Robinson took Day out after falling behind Lidle\, 2-0\, in the sixth.
 \n\n\"[Day] has to be better than that as far as pitching out there peri
 od\,\" Robinson said. \"It forces me to get people warmed up in the bull
 pen and think that I can't let the game get away. It kind of wears on yo
 u after a while.\n\n\"Day threw two balls in that situation. I just felt
  at that time I had to get someone that could throw a strike\, get the o
 ut and get out of the inning.\"\n\nAsked if he was upset about being tak
 en out of the game with the count 2-0 to Lidle\, Day said\, \"I'm not go
 ing to go there.\"\n\nAsked 15 minutes later if he was angry with Robins
 on\, Day said\, \"I'm just not going to go there.\"\n\nIn the inning\, D
 ay was charged with two unearned runs. Utley started things off with a w
 alk and then David Bell hit a perfect double play ball to shortstop Cris
 tian Guzman\, who booted it for an error. Day left the game before relie
 ver Hector Carrasco gave up a two-run single to Placido Polanco.\n\nDay 
 (1-2) wound up pitching 5 1/3 innings and gave up five run -- three earn
 ed -- on five hits. He struck out two but walked five. Day had problems

 his out pitch.\n\n\"I tried to battle and it's frustrating right now. I 
 tried to keep the team in the game\,\" he said.\n\nThe Nationals made it
  close late. In the bottom of the sixth\, Brian Schneider made it 5-3 wi

  drive in Vidro\, who led off the eighth with a triple\, to make it 5-4.

DESCRIPTION:Win: 5-4\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- Two er
 rors by Chicago second baseman Neifi Perez helped the Nationals edge the
  Cubs\, 5-4\, in front of 44\,103 at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium on Sunday
  afternoon.\nIt was the second-largest crowd at RFK this season.\n\nWith
  the score tied at 4 in the bottom of the sixth inning and reliever Clif
 f Bartosh on the mound\, the Nationals were able to score the go-ahead r
 un. Ryan Church led off and reached base on an error by Perez. After Chu
 rch advanced to second base on a sacrifice by Brian Schneider\, Cristian
  Guzman hit a ground ball that went through the legs of Perez\, which al
 lowed Church to score.\n\n\"We got a little help today\, and we needed i
 t\,\" Robinson said. \"They got a little help in the first inning\, but 
 it's neither here nor there. In the end\, we did a little bit more.\"\n\
 nThe winning pitcher was Hector Carrasco\, while Bartosh took the loss. 
 Closer Chad Cordero picked up his ninth save of the season.\n\nIt was Ca
 rrasco who really saved the game for the Nationals. In the sixth inning\
 , with the score tied at 4\, Robinson took starter John Patterson out of
  the game in favor of Carrasco after Patterson walked pinch-hitter Todd 
 Hollandsworth to load the bases with two outs. With one pitch\, Carrasco
  induced Corey Patterson to pop up to second base to end the inning.\n\n
 \"It was a pivotal point as far as we are concerned defensively\,\" Robi
 nson said. \"They didn't do any more damage\, and we came back and got t
 he one run\, which was enough for us. Had that been a big inning\, that 
 would have taken us out of the ballgame.\"\n\nFor Carrasco\, it was his 
 first victory since 2003\, when he was with the Orioles. Carrasco said t
 hat this season is the first time in his 10-year Major League career tha
 t he has been given a chance to pitch in tight situations.\n\n\"I threw 
 a cut fastball and I jammed Patterson\, and I got him out\,\" Carrasco s
 aid. \"I feel pretty good because it was a tough situation\, especially 
 because it was a tie game.\"\n\nNeither Patterson nor Chicago starter Gr
 eg Maddux figured in the decision.\n\nPatterson\, who pitched on seven d
 ays' rest because of the off-day last Thursday\, pitched 5 2/3 innings a
 nd gave up four runs on seven hits. He admitted that the long rest hurt 
 him in the first inning\, when he gave up a two-run single to Michael Ba
 rrett. After that\, Patterson had serious problems with the mound. Accor
 ding to the starter\, the landing area was very slippery.\n\n\"I don't w
 ant to use excuses\, but they have to do something with the mound. It's 
 in bad shape\,\" Patterson said. \"I battled with it all day. It gets lo
 ose and it's sliding everywhere. I slipped on 90 percent of my pitches.\
 n\n\"I battled. Mentally\, I think I held it together and kept the team 
 in the game\, and the bullpen came in and did a great job.\"\n\nMaddux p
 itched five innings and also gave up four runs on seven hits\, including
  a two-run home run to Nick Johnson.\n\nHowever\, Maddux didn't blame th
 e mound for his inconsistency\, even though he asked the grounds crew to
  fix the hole in the landing area created by Patterson in the bottom of 
 the fifth inning.\n\n\"The grounds crew\, I thought\, did a super job to
  fix it\,\" Maddux said of the mound. \"It's nice to have excuses why yo
 u screw up\, but [the mound] wasn't one of them.\"\n\nThe Nationals won 
 the series against the Cubs by taking two out of three games and improvi
 ng their record to 20-17. In those two victories\, the Nationals were ab
 le to hold their own against Carlos Zambrano and Maddux.\n\n\"It showed 
 a lot of guts to win two in a row to take the series against two pretty 
 good pitchers\,\" outfielder Brad Wilkerson said. \"We had great pitchin
 g\, good defense and some timely hitting. We are starting to play better
  and\, hopefully\, we can just continue on against the Brewers.\"\n\nThe
  Nationals play a four-game series against the Brewers\, who won five ou
 t of six games against the Expos last year.\n\nThis story was not subjec

DESCRIPTION:Win: 9-3\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nSAN FRANCISCO -- A f
 our-run rally in the top of the fourth inning helped the Nationals defea
 t the Giants\, 9-3\, in front of 40\,425 people at SBC Park on Friday ni
 ght.\nThe Nationals were down\, 2-0\, when they scored four runs off lef
 t-hander Noah Lowry (1-3). With the bases loaded and one out\, Jamey Car
 roll\, filling in for the injured Jose Vidro at second base\, blooped a 
 single to right field to score Cristian Guzman and cut the lead to 2-1.\
 n\nAfter Jose Guillen popped up for the second out of the inning\, Vinny
  Castilla singled to right field to drive in Gary Bennett and Brad Wilke
 rson and give the Nationals a 3-2 lead.\n\nNick Johnson followed and add
 ed to the lead by hitting a single up the middle\, which scored Carroll.
 \n\n\"It takes more than one person to do the job. We are starting to ge
 t production throughout the lineup\,\" manager Frank Robinson said. \"We
  are getting big hits from people that are not playing everyday. That al
 so helps.\"\n\nSaid Bennett\, \"There's no sense of give up in here. It 
 doesn't matter the situation\, we are not going to back down. We are goi
 ng to keep playing hard.\"\n\nThe Nationals poured it on the top of the 
 eighth inning by scoring five runs off four different relievers. Ryan Ch
 urch\, who replaced an injured Guillen in the seventh inning\, highlight
 ed the scoring by hitting a three-run double off Al Levine.\n\nThe winni
 ng pitcher was reliever Jon Rauch\, who pitched three shutout innings. H
 e struck out two batters and walked four. It was amazing that Rauch had 
 a good game because Robinson had Rauch up three times in the bullpen bef
 ore finally putting him into the game.\n\n\"I didn't have my best stuff\
 , obviously\, but I was able to make pitches when I needed to. I made so
 me big outs\,\" Rauch said. \"Getting up in the bullpen is part of the j
 ob. You do what you do and you get ready for any situation. They could m
 ake any kind of move at any time. So you want to make sure that you are 
 ready and don't overdo it at the same time.\"\n\nOverall\, with Luis Aya
 la and Chad Cordero in the mix\, the bullpen pitched five shutout inning
 s.\n\n\"Their performance overall was very good\,\" Robinson said of the
  bullpen. \"They kept the score right where it was and they took over th
 e game. You couldn't ask any better with what they did. That was the ide
 a.\"\n\nRauch prevented the game from getting out of hand because starte
 r Tomo Ohka was back to his old self -- being inconsistent on mound. Unl
 ike his last start\, in which he threw six shutout innings against the M
 ets\, Ohka was not attacking the strike zone. He threw 71 pitches\, but 
 35 of them went for strikes. Ohka struck out none and walked three.\n\nO
 hka's velocity was down and he was pitching slower than normal again.\n\
 n\"He had one decent game and then he reverted back to what was doing be
 fore. You can only take so much of that\,\" Robinson said. \"Every innin
 g he's one pitch away from disaster. You have your bullpen up [numerous 
 times]\, so if you are going to get them up\, you might as well get them
  into the game.\n\n\"Ohka was slow the first part of the game and he cou
 ldn't get his off-speed pitches over the plate. The velocity was down. H
 e picked it up later\, but he was still getting behind hitters and getti
 ng people on base almost every inning. It stretches your bullpen.\"\n\nO
 hka felt he could have pitched longer and was getting better by the four
 th inning. He acknowledged that some of his fastballs were not good and 
 reiterated that he was healthy.\n\nAsked if he was upset about being tak
 en out of the game\, Ohka said\, \"I don't want to say anything. That's 
 wise. It's a manager's decision. I had mechanical problems.\"\n\nThe Gia
 nts scored two runs in the second on a single by Edgardo Alfonzo and a s
 acrifice fly by Mike Matheny. In the third\, Deivi Cruz hit his second h
 ome run of the season.\n\nThis story was not subject to the approval of

DESCRIPTION:Win: 3-1\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- As the
  Nationals were taking batting practice at Robert F. Kennedy Stadium on 
 Wednesday afternoon\, Carlos Baerga wanted to find a way to keep the tea
 m loose and together.\nThe backup infielder led nine position players be
 hind the batting cage\, including Jose Vidro\, Brad Wilkerson and Gary B
 ennett\, and like a football team before the opening kickoff\, the playe
 rs put their hands together and said: \"Go out there and kill them.\"\n\
 n\"We were just having a little fun\, trying to stay relaxed and loose\,
 \" Wilkerson said.\n\nThe Nationals didn't exactly kill the Dodgers on W
 ednesday night\, but they received enough timely hitting to defeat Los A
 ngeles\, 3-1\, in front of 36\,552.\n\nPreston Wilson provided most of t
 he offense as he went 2-for-4 with two RBIs.\n\nThe Nationals were trail
 ing\, 1-0\, when Wilson took a 2-1 fastball from right-hander D.J. Hoult
 on over the center-field wall for a two-run homer. It was Wilson's 18th 
 home run of the season and his third homer since being acquired from the
  Rockies on July 13.\n\n\"I hit that one pretty good\,\" Wilson said. \"
 It put us ahead. With our pitchers out there\, we like our chances when 
 we have the lead.\"\n\nPrivately\, the Nationals were shocked at the way
  Wilson was performing on the field prior to Wednesday's action. He was 
 striking out at an alarming rate -- 20 times in 59 at-bats -- and was sh
 aky on defense.\n\nThat's not what the Nationals expected when they acqu
 ired him at a time when Washington was 2 1/2 games ahead of Atlanta in t
 he National League East. The Nationals expected Wilson to boost thier of
 fense. Instead\, it continued to sputter -- until Wednesday night.\n\n\"
 Tonight\, I felt pretty good\,\" Wilson said. \"I felt like I was seeing
  that ball and putting decent swings on pitches that I wanted to. I just
  have to try to make it carry over toward more at-bats.\"\n\nThe Nationa
 ls added an insurance run in the bottom of the eighth inning when Nick J
 ohnson hit a solo home run off Giovanni Carrara. It was the first time s
 ince June 30 that the Nationals have had a multi-homer game.\n\nThe offe
 nse wasn't totally perfect. They missed two opportunities to score runs 
 early in the game. In first inning\, Wilkerson was on third base with on
 e out\, but Guillen popped up to second baseman Jeff Kent and Johnson st
 ruck out to end the inning.\n\nIn the next inning\, Wilson destroyed a r
 ally as he was picked of at second base with one out.\n\n\"These are som
 e of the things that have been catching up with us during the second hal
 f -- those little mistakes that we have been making\,\" manager Frank Ro
 binson said. \"We didn't do those things early on. It seems to be a dail
 y basis during the second half of the season.\"\n\nThe winning pitcher w
 as Tony Armas Jr.\, who had to leave the game after five innings because
  of right shoulder tendinitis. He is not expected to miss his next sched
 uled start. Armas gave up one run on four hits\, struck out four batters
  and walked three.\n\nThe one run was scored in the top of the third inn
 ing\, when Milton Bradley homered over the right-field wall.\n\nReliever
 s Luis Ayala\, Mike Stanton\, Gary Majewski and Chad Cordero shut out th
 e Dodgers the rest of the way as Cordero picked up his 36th save of the 
 season.\n\n\"The bullpen has been key all year\, although it hasn't been
  used this early too often. Ayala's two innings were the key to the succ
 ess that we had tonight. They all contributed in their own way\,\" Robin
 son said.\n\nThe Nationals improved their record to 57-50 and are now 4 
 1/2 game behind the Braves in the NL East.\n\nThis story was not subject

DESCRIPTION:Win: 3-2\n\nBy David Selig / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- Home s
 weet home: where the infield is sometimes poor and the ball doesn't carr
 y\, but where the Nationals got what appeared to be a hometown call Mond
 ay\, and were able to find a way to win.\nThe Nats welcomed themselves b
 ack from a road trip -- where they lost seven of nine -- with a 3-2 win 
 against the Braves before a Memorial Day crowd of 39\,705 at Robert F. K
 ennedy Stadium.\n\nThey didn't play their best defense and were not exce
 ptional offensively\, but got by on the strength of two Marlon Byrd RBI 
 doubles and a little help from a favorable umpiring decision.\n\nAfter B
 yrd drove home Nick Johnson in the fourth and sixth to put the Nats ahea
 d 2-1\, the Braves looked like they were about to tie the game in the se
 venth.\n\nBrian Jordan slapped a fly ball to left that appeared to have 
 grazed the foul pole\, and was originally ruled a home run by third-base
  umpire Jerry Layne. But after Nationals manager Frank Robinson marched 
 into the outfield and \"reasoned\" with Layne and crew chief Ed Montague
  for a few minutes\, the umpires convened and ruled it a foul ball. Jord
 an was retired on the next pitch.\n\n\"It did not hit the foul pole\,\" 
 said left fielder Byrd\, who argued the call immediately. \"It came stra
 ight down.\"\n\nChad Cordero\, who was in the bullpen where the ball lan
 ded\, said after the game that it had a green spot on it\, but no signs 
 of yellow paint from the pole.\n\nThe fence and bullpen wall are green a
 nd the bottom foot of the foul pole\, which is where the ball appeared t
 o hit\, is painted black.\n\nMontague\, who was umpiring from second bas
 e\, ultimately decided that the ball landed outside of the pole.\n\nThe 
 call became the deciding factor\, as an insurance run driven home by Jos
 e Guillen in the bottom of the seventh was countered by an Andruw Jones 
 solo home run off Cordero in the ninth. The closer induced a fly out to 
 Johnny Estrada to pick up his 12th save and allow the festive crowd to w
 ipe the sweat off its collective brow.\n\nWhen he wasn't playing witness
  in the case of the disputed call\, Byrd continued his tear at the plate
 . He is hitting .371 with has eight RBIs since being obtained May 14 fro
 m the Phillies\, with six of his 13 hits and seven of those RBIs coming 
 at RFK.\n\n\"You want to be out there any way that you can\,\" said Byrd
 \, who did not get much playing time with Philadelphia. \"I know I'm pla
 tooning right now\, so when I get out there\, I have to do my job and ke
 ep producing.\"\n\nTomo Ohka is also finding his place in Washington. Th
 e right-hander gave up just one run in seven innings.\n\n\"He kind of pi
 tched his way into a good rhythm and velocity\,\" Robinson said. \"If he
  continues to pitch the way he is capable of pitching -- and the way he'
 s pitched in his last two starts -- it certainly is going to make us a b
 etter ball club.\n\nSince starting the season 2-3 with a 5.85 ERA in fiv
 e starts\, Ohka is 3-0 with a 1.76 ERA in his past five appearances (fou
 r were starts).\n\n\"First of all\, he's not walking guys -- which is al
 lowing less guys to get on base -- and second of all\, he's back up to 8
 9 [miles per hour] at will\,\" catcher Brian Schneider said.\n\nThe over
 all level of play Monday wasn't markedly better than during the road tri
 p.\n\nTwice Nationals runners were thrown out on hit-and-runs\, and Guil
 len was thrown out from short\, trying to score from third on a grounder
  with nobody out.\n\nRobinson did not blame his baserunner\, saying that
  the Braves' Rafael Furcal is the only shortstop that could make such a 
 throw playing deep in the hole. But Robinson did not defend the National
 s' defense.\n\nIn the third inning\, second baseman Jamey Carroll had a 
 ball bounce off his glove allowing Jordan to reach and Estrada to get to
  second. Jordan was ultimately awarded a hit\, but Vinny Castilla made a
 n error later in the inning.\n\nCastilla was eaten up by a chopper to th
 ird\, which let Estrada score and gave the Braves a 1-0 lead. Carroll bo
 bbled another grounder in the sixth\, turning a double-play ball into a 
 fielder's choice\, as Carroll recovered and got the out at first.\n\nWhi
 le the often-maligned field conditions at RFK Stadium didn't necessarily
  cause those blunders\, the deep fences certainly made Guillen's return 
 to the nation's capital bittersweet.\n\nGuillen hit two singles\, includ
 ing a two-out liner up the middle in the seventh that eventually became 
 the game-winning RBI.\n\nBut he also blasted two balls that died in the 
 outfield and turned into harmless fly-outs.\n\n\"In my book\, I went 4-f
 or-4\, because I could not have hit those two balls any better\,\" he sa
 id. \"I do not believe that is 380 feet [deep in the alleys]. I do not b
 elieve it's 410 in straightaway [center field]. I still do not believe w
 hat they say that when it gets warm that the ball's going to carry\, bec
 ause it was pretty warm today\, and I crushed those two balls.\"\n\nWhil
 e he thinks the Nationals might want to re-measure the distance to the f
 ence in right- and left-center field\, Guillen is as happy as the rest o
 f his teammates to be home.\n\n\"The fans have been supporting us 100 pe
 rcent from the first inning to the last inning\, and that's great\,\" Gu
 illen said.\n\nEven players who flourish on the road responded to the re
 turn to D.C. Johnson had been hitting just .265 at home this season\, bu
 t smacked three hits and scored a pair of runs.\n\nSetup man Gary Majews
 ki hasn't allowed a run away from RFK\, but pitched a perfect eighth.\n\
 n\"Being here\, and feeling the atmosphere and the excitement of the cro
 wd\, it makes a big difference\,\" said Robinson\, whose team is 13-8 at
  home compared with 13-17 on the road.\n\nThe Nationals hope to use that

SUMMARY:(L) vs Reds
DESCRIPTION:Loss: 2-6\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- If th
 e Nationals want to go to the playoffs\, they must learn to beat teams t
 hat are playing under .500. But they didn't do that on Tuesday night\, l
 osing to the Reds\, 6-2\, in front of 35\,656 at RFK Stadium.\nThe Natio
 nals are now tied with the Mets for fourth place in the National League 
 East\, 5 1/2 games behind the Braves in that division and two behind the
  Phillies in the NL Wild Card race.\n\n\"I hate to repeat this\, but fro
 m here on out\, we have to win ballgames\,\" said manager Frank Robinson
 . \"We are one foot in last place and one foot in fourth place. We can't
  keep losing ground now and expect to jump all over these ballclubs. The
 y are playing pretty good baseball right now.\n\n\"We have to get our ac
 t together. We didn't do it tonight. We have to do it tomorrow.\"\n\nRob
 inson thought that by scoring a combined 15 runs over the previous two g
 ames against the Mets\, the Nationals would come to RFK Stadium on Tuesd
 ay and have a good night at the plate. But Reds right-hander Luke Hudson
 \, who had a 7.35 ERA entering the game\, proved to be too much for the 
 Nationals\, pitching seven solid innings and giving up two runs on four 
 hits.\n\n\"The offense didn't show up tonight\,\" said Robinson.\n\nThe 
 Nationals took a 1-0 lead in the second inning\, when Vinny Castilla hit
  his 10th home run of the season.\n\nBut it was all Reds after that\, as
  they scored four runs in the top of the third inning off Tony Armas Jr.
  Edwin Encarnacion tied the score with a home run. Three batters later\,
  Rich Aurilia singled to right field to score Hudson\, while Jose Guille
 n's error on the same hit allowed Felipe Lopez to score.\n\nWith two out
 s\, Austin Kearns doubled to drive in Aurilia.\n\nArmas left the game af
 ter three innings because of right shoulder soreness. The Nationals knew
  something was wrong with him\, because his fastball was clocked in the 
 low 80s.\n\n\"I thought Encarnacion hit a slider for the home run\,\" sa
 id Robinson. \"It was clocked at 83 miles per hour. And then I was told\
 , after the inning was over\, it was a fastball. He had one pitch before
  that\, and it was clocked at 82 miles per hour. I thought that was a br
 eaking ball. I found out it was a fastball.\"\n\nThis is the second time
  this season Armas has had shoulder problems. On Aug. 3\, he left a game
  after five innings because of tightness.\n\nThe Nationals cut the defic
 it to two runs in the fourth inning\, when Guillen hit a home run that h
 it the facing of the upper deck in left-center field. It was his 22nd ho
 me run of the season but only his second at RFK Stadium. The last time h
 e hit a home run in Washington was on April 29\, against Mets right-hand
 er Jae Seo.\n\nThe Nationals tried to play small ball in the fifth innin
 g\, but it didn't work. With runners on first and second\, Robinson put 
 on the hit-and-run play with Jamey Carroll at the plate. Carroll fouled 
 off the first pitch.\n\nRobinson scrapped the play\, but third-base coac
 h Dave Huppert didn't see the sign. Castilla ran to third\, Carroll swun
 g and missed\, and Castilla was thrown out.\n\nCarroll would go on to st
 rike out for the second out\, and Ryan Church ended the inning with a st
 rikeout.\n\n\"We had a chance in the fifth inning\, and we ran ourselves
  out of the inning\,\" said second baseman Jose Vidro. \"When you play a
  lineup like the Reds\, you really have to make sure you keep the ball d
 own to give yourself a chance to win the ballgame.\"\n\nThe Reds would m
 ake it a four-run game again off reliever Mike Stanton in the eighth inn
 ing. Jason LaRue drove in Kearns with a double down the left-field line\
 , then Encarnacion knocked in LaRue with another double.\n\n\nThis story

DESCRIPTION:Loss: 0-3\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nMIAMI -- Nationals 
 hitting coach Tom McCraw is a person who doesn't hold anything back\, an
 d Saturday afternoon was no different\, when he talked about the team's 
 offense.\n\"It stinks. We are not doing the job offensively to a man\,\"
  said McCraw.\n\nEntering Saturday's action\, the Nationals' offense ran
 ked next to last in the Major Leagues in batting average\, and 30th in h
 ome runs\, RBIs and runs scored.\n\nMcCraw said that the offense is too 
 stagnant\, as the team is waiting for the three-run home run instead of 
 playing small ball -- stealing bases or moving runners over by getting a
  base hit to right field.\n\n\"We have to think more creatively\,\" said
  McCraw. \"We just can't sit there [and look for the home run]. We haven
 't hit one in days. Try to steal a base. We are not creating. We are wai
 ting\, and when you wait\, you get your [rear] kicked in the big leagues
 .\"\n\nThe Nationals didn't get their rear ends kicked on Saturday\, but
  they created virtually nothing offensively and were blanked by the Marl
 ins\, 3-0\, in front of 25\,308 at Dolphins Stadium.\n\nWashington exten
 ded its losing streak to six games and has dropped 18 of its last 23.\n\
 nAsked if he was going to hold a meeting with the position players\, McC
 raw said\, \"We met a couple of times already. I don't know what else to
  do now. We could meet again\, but it hasn't taken effect. We have becom
 e very passive as an offensive unit. Every man in this room has gone int
 o an offensive funk.\"\n\nA meeting may not be called\, but manager Fran
 k Robinson is thinking about making changes to the lineup for Sunday aft
 ernoon's game against the Marlins. The skipper hinted that he may make t
 hree or four changes\, but didn't say whom he would bench. First\, he wa
 nts to give Sunday's starter\, Livan Hernandez\, the courtesy of knowing
  whom he might sit down\, as he wants Hernandez to believe that the best
  fielding lineup is behind him.\n\nOn Saturday the Nationals were no mat
 ch against Marlins right-hander A.J. Burnett\, who pitched seven shutout
  innings and gave up four hits. He struck out eight batters and walked o
 nly one.\n\nThe only time the Nationals made any serious threat against 
 Burnett was in the first inning. The first two runners of the game -- Br
 ad Wilkerson and Jamey Carroll -- reached base\, but Nick Johnson flew o
 ut to left field\, Vinny Castilla grounded out to put runners on second 
 and third\, and Ryan Church popped up to first baseman Jeff Conine to en
 d the inning.\n\n\"He was throwing his breaking ball over for strikes. W
 e just couldn't get anything going\,\" said Jamey Carroll\, who went 0-f
 or-3. \"It's frustrating. We can't seem to put two to three hits togethe
 r right now.\"\n\nSaid Burnett: \"I made pitches when I needed to. I had
  a good hook today and just went after them. We've got a nice little rol
 l going on here. It all starts with the starting pitching. I thought [st
 arter John] Patterson threw a good game as well\, dealing with the weath
 er. We got on top early.\"\n\nPatterson (4-3) had another solid outing\,
  but came away with nothing to show for it. He lasted six innings and ga
 ve up two runs on five hits. He struck out six batters and walked three.
 \n\n\"I felt pretty good\,\" said Patterson. \"The fastball and slider w
 ere pretty good. I didn't have much of a curveball. It was pretty useles
 s except to show it early in the game.\"\n\nPatterson also threw three w
 ild pitches\, two of which ended up hurting him. In the second inning\, 
 with Paul Lo Duca on second base and Mike Lowell at the plate\, Patterso
 n uncorked a wild pitch on a curveball. Catcher Brian Schneider tried to
  throw out Lo Duca at third base but threw the ball past Castilla\, whic
 h allowed Lo Duca to score.\n\nIn the sixth inning\, Lo Duca was on thir
 d base when he scored on another Patterson wild pitch -- this time on a 
 slider -- to give the Marlins a 2-0 lead.\n\nAlong with his three losses
 \, Patterson has 12 no-decisions. After Saturday's game\, he was almost 
 speechless. He feels that at times that he and the rest of the staff hav
 e had to be perfect because of the lack of the run support\, but said th
 at the lack of run support makes the pitchers smarter.\n\n\"Right now we
  have to be perfect. Hopefully\, that changes tomorrow\,\" he said. \"[T
 he lack of run support] makes you a little smarter. You try to make a sm
 arter pitch. When you have runs on the board\, you don't tend to do that
 . You try to be aggressive and make [them] hit the ball.\"\n\nIn the sev
 enth inning\, Gary Majewski gave up an RBI double to Miguel Cabrera. Tha
 t run was charged to left-hander Joey Eischen.\n\n\"We didn't do much of
  anything today except the first inning. We could have gotten something 
 going and maybe had a chance to win a ballgame\,\" said Robinson. \"Patt

SUMMARY:(L) vs Astros
DESCRIPTION:Loss: 1-14\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- The 
 Nationals have one of the best home records in baseball\, yet some of th
 em have worried more about the dimensions of spacious Robert F. Kennedy 
 Stadium and about how they are being robbed of home runs.\nIt seems odd 
 now\, because the Astros didn't have any problems hitting there as they 
 routed the Nationals\, 14-1\, in front of 38\,019 fans on Friday night.\
 n\nHere's proof of how the Astros were not affected by the vast RFK Stad
 ium. In the first inning\, Morgan Ensberg gave the Astros a 2-0 lead whe
 n he took Ryan Drese's first pitch out for a two-run home run out to lef
 t-center. The ball hit the scoreboard above the Toyota sign behind the o
 utfield wall\, 395 feet from home plate.\n\nDrese gave up six runs -- fi
 ve earned -- in 6 1/3 innings. He struck out four batters and walked two
 .\n\nDrese's line doesn't look good on the surface\, but manager Frank R
 obinson thought Drese pitched a good ballgame. Entering the seventh inni
 ng\, Drese had given up only three runs. He left the ballgame with runne
 rs on first and third with one out.\n\nIn Drese's defense\, the National
 s did not play good defense behind him.\n\n\"I thought he pitched pretty
  well myself\,\" Robinson said. \"I figured that he gave up two runs on 
 the home run [by Ensberg]. When you don't score and you are not as sharp
  on the field as you should be\, you are going to lose ballgames.\"\n\nR
 eliever Sun-Woo Kim replaced Drese and had to take one for the team\, as
  he gave up eight runs in 1 2/3 innings. Mike Lamb also didn't seem to h
 ave problems with the dimensions\, hitting a three-run home run to right
  field off Kim.\n\nKim knew all along that he was in the game to save th
 e bullpen.\n\n\"I had bad location today\,\" Kim said. \"Everything was 
 in the middle of the plate. I was hanging the curveball and they were sw
 inging with confidence.\"\n\nThe Nationals were no match for Astros righ
 t-hander Roger Clemens\, who pitched six shutout innings. He gave up thr
 ee hits\, struck out 10 batters and walked three. Three of those strikeo
 uts came from outfielder Preston Wilson. Overall\, Wilson struck out fou
 r times in the game.\n\n\"He mixed his pitches and he came right after y
 ou\,\" said outfielder Ryan Church. \"He was aggressive. That's just him
 . That's his track record.\"\n\nJose Guillen was more to the point.\n\n\
 "We just got our [behinds] kicked. That's it. It's as simple as that\,\"
  Guillen said. \"We just have to come back tomorrow and try to do our be
 st and let's forget about today. Clemens was on his game today. I told y
 ou guys we were going to face some very tough guys this series\, and I t
 hink you guys have seen it all ready.\"\n\nThe Nationals' best opportuni
 ty to score against Clemens occurred in the sixth inning. They had runne
 rs on first and second and no outs\, but Wilson struck out and both Brad
  Wilkerson and Brian Schneider flied out to left field.\n\nWashington al
 so had a golden opportunity to score in the seventh inning against relie
 ver Chad Qualls.\n\nCristian Guzman led off with a triple but was left s
 tranded. Kim grounded out to Qualls\, Jamey Carroll grounded out to firs
 t baseman Lance Berkman and Jose Vidro grounded to Craig Biggio to end t
 he inning.\n\nThe Nationals scored their only run in the eighth inning w
 hen Church doubled off reliever Dan Wheeler to score Carlos Baerga.\n\n\
 "I hope this is a wakeup call for us. We have to bounce back. Hopefully\
 , tonight\, we learned a lesson. Tomorrow\, we could come back and try t
 o gain some confidence\,\" Wilkerson said. \"We have to come out ready t
 o play and not give in. We have to take it upon ourselves to have a grea
 t at-bat and see what happens. We are not doing it right now.\"\n\nWith 
 the Braves' loss in Arizona\, the Nationals found themselves tied for th
 e NL East lead. The Nationals have spent 58 days in first place. Wilkers
 on said it's too early to worry about the Braves.\n\n\"We need to take c
 are of our own business. If we don't do that\, it doesn't matter who is 
 up there in the standings\,\" Wilkerson said. \"If we don't start playin
 g better and find a way to score runs\, play better defense and playing 
 harder\, I think it's going to be a long year for us.\"\n\nGuillen is op
 timistic that Nationals can turn things around.\n\n\"Nothing is clicking
  for us right now. Nobody here likes to lose. Everybody wants to go in t
 here and try to win\,\" Guillen said. \"We try to do our best. It was gr
 eat in the first half. Hopefully\, we will stop this slump as soon as po
 ssible. We have our fans behind us. I still think we are going to be all
  right. We have a lot of games left. It's just one of those days.\"\n\nT

SUMMARY:(L) @ Atlanta
DESCRIPTION:Loss: 4-5\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nATLANTA -- Outfield
 er Jose Guillen refuses to believe that the Braves are better than the N
 ationals. He pointed out that Atlanta mainstays such as Andruw Jones and
  Chipper Jones were not the ones that led the team to a three-game sweep
 . It was the bit players\, such as Marcus Giles and Jeff Francoeur\, who
  did most of the damage.\nOn Thursday afternoon\, it was Francoeur's two
  home runs that helped the Braves edge the Nationals\, 5-4\, in front of
  40\,269 at Turner Field.\n\nThe Nationals are now on a four-game losing
  streak\, 3-12 since the All-Star break and three games behind the Brave
 s in the National League East.\n\n\"You look at all those guys that have
  the responsibility to win the three games. It was not Chipper or Andruw
 . You let me know if the guys they have are better than our guys. It's n
 ot acceptable to get swept\,\" Guillen said. \"We are playing like a Dou
 ble-A team. This is ridiculous.\"\n\nRight-hander Ryan Drese was the sta
 rter for the Nationals. His sinker wasn't in top form as he gave up four
  runs -- three earned -- in four innings.\n\nThe first run was scored in
  the third inning. With a runner on third base and one out\, Chipper Jon
 es hit a ground ball to third baseman Vinny Castilla\, who threw to catc
 her Brian Schneider. But Schneider let the ball go by him for an error\,
  allowing Rafael Furcal to score on the play.\n\n\"The throw was to my r
 ight. That's a play where you have Furcal running in. It's not a do-or-d
 ie play\, but it's like I can't move my feet. If I move my feet and go c
 atch that ball\, there's no chance to get back and tag Furcal\,\" Schnei
 der said.\n\nThe Braves scored three more runs off Drese in the fourth i
 nning as Francoeur hit a one-out solo home run and Giles drove in Ryan L
 angerhans and Furcal with a two-out double to left field.\n\nBefore givi
 ng up the Giles double\, Drese said\, he would have gotten out of the in
 ning had he not tried to pitch around Furcal\, who walked to put runners
  on first and second.\n\n\"We didn't want Furcal to jump on the first pi
 tch\, so we started him off with changeups\,\" Drese said. \"We do have 
 a righty on deck\, but\, still\, it's stupid to put another guy on base.
  I should have gone after Furcal. I didn't. I paid the price and I hung 
 the slider [to Giles].\"\n\nWashington made it a game against Braves rig
 ht-hander Jorge Sosa in the fifth and sixth innings.\n\nCarlos Baerga\, 
 pinch-hitting for Drese\, hit an infield single to bring in Nick Johnson
  in the fifth. The next inning\, Guillen singled to right field to drive
  in Vidro.\n\nBut Francoeur ended up driving in the game-winning run whe
 n he hit his second home run of the game off Sun-Woo Kim in the bottom o
 f the sixth inning.\n\nFrancoeur ended up going 5-for-8 (.625) in the se
 ries. According to Drese\, the scouting report said that Francoeur could
 n't hit the inside pitch.\n\n\"He turned on the fastball down and in and
  hit the home run\,\" Drese said. \"Maybe we stayed inside too much on h
 im. It's tough when you don't have that many at-bats on this guy. You ha
 ve to go with your instinct. Tip your hat. He hit the ball well.\"\n\nTh
 e Nationals got within one run in the seventh inning\, when Vidro hit a 
 two-run home run off reliever Jim Brower.\n\nWashington had a chance to 
 tie the score in the bottom of the eighth inning. The Nationals had runn
 ers on first and third with two outs\, but left-hander Macay McBride str
 uck out pinch-hitter Ryan Church to end the threat.\n\nThe missed opport
 unity was one of many for the Nationals throughout the three-game series
 . When they had runners in scoring position with less than two outs\, mo
 re often than not\, they didn't take advantage of the situation.\n\n\"Wh
 en we had a runner on third\, we couldn't put the ball in play\,\" Guill
 en said. \"We came up and hit into double plays. ... I don't see the fir
 e like I saw in the first half of the season. A lot of these guys look l
 ike they want to go home. That's the way we look on the field. I hope we
  figure out that it's a long season. We can put it together from this po
 int on.\"\n\nAfter the game\, manager Frank Robinson had his second team
  meeting in as many days\, but this time\, he told his players that they
  put in a great effort on Thursday. The previous night\, Robinson scolde
 d the players for not having a lot of energy on the field in their 4-3 l
 oss.\n\n\"I saw a better game from us tonight\,\" Vidro said \"Hopefully
  we will get going. I saw a better attitude out there today. I'm sure th
 ings are about to change. It can't get any worse.\"\n\nThis story was no

DESCRIPTION:Win: 6-5\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nHOUSTON -- Before Tu
 esday's game against the Astros\, manager Frank Robinson said that it di
 dn't matter how well the team pitched -- the Nationals had to score at l
 east four or five runs to win the game.\nRobinson was proven right.\n\nT
 he Nationals\, the lowest-scoring team in baseball\, put on their hittin
 g shoes and defeated the Astros\, 6-5\, in front of 34\,255 at Minute Ma
 id Park. The win snapped a 13-game losing streak in which the Nationals 
 lost by one run.\n\nThe Nationals also find themselves one game behind H
 ouston in the National League Wild Card race and 5 1/2 games behind the 
 Braves in the NL East.\n\nThe Nationals played the first of 13 games on 
 the road\, and they realize they must win most of them to stay in conten
 tion. Tuesday's contest was a good start.\n\nOn Sunday afternoon\, the N
 ationals called up outfielder Brandon Watson to provide a spark\, and he
  did just that in his Major League debut\, going 2-for-5 with a home run
  and two runs scored.\n\n\"It was a beautiful debut for him. He was all 
 right. He held his own up there and helped us win a ballgame\,\" said Ro
 binson.\n\nAfter the game\, two balls were spotted in Watson's locker --
  one for his first big-league hit and another for the home run. He didn'
 t know which one was which\, but he didn't care.\n\n\"It felt good to he
 lp the team in any way\, shape or form. I was so happy that we won\,\" s
 aid the shy Watson.\n\nThe Nationals started the scoring in the second\,
  when Brad Wilkerson hit Ezequiel Astacio's 2-2 pitch over the right-cen
 ter field wall for his eighth home run of the season.\n\nJohn Patterson 
 (6-3) was on the mound for the Nationals\, and he didn't come close to h
 aving the performance he had on Thursday against the Dodgers\, in which 
 he struck out 13 batters. Pitching in front of family and friends for th
 e first time in his big-league career\, the native Texan pitched 5 2/3 i
 nnings against Houston and gave up five runs -- three earned -- on seven
  hits. He struck out only two batters and walked three.\n\nEven before t
 he start of the game\, Robinson thought Patterson was going to have a to
 ugh night\, because most of his warmup pitches were in the dirt.\n\n\"Pa
 tterson didn't have his good stuff. He didn't have his good control. I k
 new that by the time he warmed up in the first inning. But he took us in
 to the sixth inning\,\" said Robinson.\n\nThe Astros tied the score in t
 he bottom of the second inning\, when Morgan Ensberg hit his 30th home r
 un of the season.\n\nBut the Nationals regained the lead in the next fra
 me. After Patterson singled to right and Watson doubled down the right-f
 ield line to put runners on second and third\, Jose Vidro hit a sacrific
 e fly to center field to score Patterson.\n\nAfter Nick Johnson walked\,
  Vinny Castilla grounded out\, but Watson scored on the play.\n\nThe Nat
 ionals added two more runs off Astacio in the fourth\, when both Brian S
 chneider and Watson homered to give them a 5-1 lead. Watson became the f
 ourth player in Nationals/Expos history to hit a home run in his Major L
 eague debut.\n\n\"I didn't stop running even when it went out\,\" said W
 atson. \"I wanted to run hard. I don't hit home runs. I hit it pretty go
 od\, and it went out of the ballpark.\"\n\nIn the fifth\, Castilla made 
 it a 6-1 game when he homered off reliever Chad Harville.\n\n\"It was go
 od to see the offense early in the game\, but I wish it didn't stop\,\" 
 said Robinson. \"I would have liked us to add a run or two. But it shoul
 dn't been that close tonight. We played better than the score indicated.
 \"\n\nThe Astros made it a one-run game by the bottom of the sixth innin
 g.\n\nWith Patterson on the mound in the bottom of the fifth\, Ensberg h
 it his second homer of the game\, a two-run shot\, to cut the lead by th
 ree.\n\nThen the defense betrayed the Nationals in the sixth inning. Wit
 h runners on first and second and two outs\, Willy Taveras hit a routine
  ground ball to Cristian Guzman\, who was going for the force. Though Jo
 se Vidro was late covering the bag\, Guzman threw the ball to the second
  baseman anyway\, for what looked to be a forceout to end the inning. Bu
 t second-base umpire Wally Bell called Eric Bruntlett safe. Robinson arg
 ued with Bell for several minutes\, to no avail.\n\nReplays showed that 
 Bruntlett was out.\n\nIt would get worse for the Nationals. With the bas
 es loaded\, Robinson took Patterson out of the game in favor of right-ha
 nder Luis Ayala. The next hitter\, Craig Biggio\, hit another routine gr
 ound ball to Guzman. Guzman looked to get the force at second\, but Vidr
 o was not there. Instead\, Guzman went to first base and threw the ball 
 away. Both Brad Ausmus and Bruntlett scored on the play.\n\nAccording to
  Wilkerson and Vidro\, Guzman was very upset after making the error.\n\n
 \"I know he was very upset coming into the dugout. That was pleasing to 
 see\, that he's taking it in the right way\,\" said Wilkerson. \"He know
 s that play meant a lot. It's pleasing to see that somebody really cares
  that much after making the error.\"\n\nSaid Vidro: \"I still have a lot
  of confidence in Guzy. But the main thing is that we came back.\"\n\nAy
 ala\, Mike Stanton\, Gary Majewski and Chad Cordero shut out the Astros 
 the rest of the way\, with Cordero picking up his 37th save of the seaso
 n.\n\n\nThis story was not subject to the approval of Major League Baseb

SUMMARY:(W) @ Atlanta
DESCRIPTION:Win: 3-2\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nATLANTA -- Although 
 his team is 15-27 in the second half and in fifth place in the National 
 League East\, Nationals manager Frank Robinson still has visions of winn
 ing the division title.\nHis dream may not be too farfetched\, as four r
 elievers shut out the Braves for 6 1/3 innings and helped Washington edg
 e Atlanta\, 3-2\, in front of 20\,001 at Turner Field on Tuesday night.\
 n\nWith the victory\, the Nationals cut the Braves' lead to six games in
  the National League East and are now just 1 1/2 games behind the Philli
 es and Marlins in the Wild Card race.\n\n\"I said the other day that the
 y are going to let us hang around here and let us win this thing\,\" Rob
 inson said. \"They have given us a chance. There is no reason we should 
 be where we are in the Wild Card if other teams were playing decent.\n\n
 \"You know the old saying\, 'Don't let a guy hang around if you have a c
 hance to knock him out.' They had a chance knock us out the entire secon
 d half of the season and they haven't done it yet. Maybe\, we'll bounce 
 back off the ropes\, get off the canvas and win this thing.\"\n\nThe Bra
 ves had a chance to knock out the Nationals early in Tuesday's game. Nat
 ionals right-handed starter John Patterson had to leave the game because
  of stomach cramps. He pitched 2 2/3 innings and gave up two runs on thr
 ee hits\, striking out two and walking three.\n\nIn the bottom of the th
 ird inning\, with runners on first and second\, two outs and the Braves 
 already leading 1-0\, Patterson was sweating profusely. In fact\, his un
 iform top was already drenched in sweat.\n\nWith Chipper Jones at the pl
 ate\, Patterson called pitching coach Randy St. Claire and trainer Tim A
 braham to the mound. Seconds later Robinson went to meet them. Although 
 Robinson considered pulling Patterson\, catcher Brian Schneider convince
 d Robinson to keep Patterson in the game.\n\nPatterson insisted that he 
 could go on and proceeded to walk Chipper Jones to load the bases\, then
  give Andruw Jones a free pass that forced home Kelly Johnson.\n\nRobins
 on then took Patterson out of the game in favor of reliever Jason Bergma
 nn\, who proceeded to get Adam LaRoche to ground out to end the inning.\
 n\n\"I was looking at Patterson and I had the feeling that he wasn't rig
 ht\,\" Robinson said. \"I didn't like his mannerisms on the mound. Since
  he didn't say anything\, I thought he was OK and he would get himself s
 traightened out.\"\n\nBut it was Bergmann\, Hector Carrasco\, Gary Majew
 ski and Chad Cordero\, who blanked the Braves the rest of the way. The f
 oursome combined to give up just six hits\, strikeout six batters and wa
 lk four.\n\n\"The bullpen has come through a lot of times this year. We 
 needed the bullpen tonight and they did a tremendous job\,\" Robinson sa
 id.\n\nBergmann picked up his first career victory\, while Cordero picke
 d up his 42nd save of the season.\n\n\"The bullpen has been great all ye
 ar. I was fortunate enough to be called up in a situation where we have 
 great pitchers in the bullpen and we are in a pennant race. I've been lu
 cky to contribute a little bit\,\" Bergmann said.\n\nIn the fourth innin
 g\, with Braves' starter Jorge Sosa on the mound\, Jose Guillen took a 1
 -1 pitch and hit it over the left-field wall to cut the lead to one run.
  It was Guillen's 24th home run of the season.\n\nThat run snapped a 24-
 inning scoreless streak for the Nationals.\n\nAn inning later\, the Nati
 onals added two more runs to take the lead. After Bergmann singled and B
 rad Wilkerson flied out\, Vidro doubled to right-center field to drive i
 n Bergmann\, tying the score at 2. Vidro was thrown out trying to stretc
 h the hit into a triple.\n\nIn the same inning\, Preston Wilson singled 
 to right center to score Nick Johnson and give the Nationals the lead.\n
 \n\"I had checked swings at a couple of pitches early. I got myself behi
 nd\,\" Wilson said. \"I was able to stay in the at-bat long enough until
  I was able to get the hit.\"\n\nThis story was not subject to the appro

SUMMARY:(L) vs Braves
DESCRIPTION:Loss: 7-9\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- Manag
 er Frank Robinson made lineup changes for Sunday's game against the Brav
 es. He benched third baseman Vinny Castilla\, outfielder Preston Wilson 
 and infielder Deivi Cruz in favor of Ryan Zimmerman\, Ryan Church and Ri
 ck Short\, respectively.\nRobinson said he wanted to inject new energy i
 nto the starting lineup\, and it worked for a while. The Nationals event
 ually fell to the Braves\, 9-7\, in front of 31\,834 fans at Robert F. K
 ennedy Stadium\, but not before they mounted a thrilling rally to overco
 me\, albeit briefly\, a six-run deficit.\n\nThe loss\, Robinson said\, p
 ut the Nationals in a deep hole as far as making the playoffs. With a 73
 -71 record\, the Nats remain four games behind the Astros in the Wild Ca
 rd race\, but they also need to jump ahead of the Phillies and Marlins.\
 n\n\"There's still hope. We are not mathematically eliminated\,\" Robins
 on said. \"We'll keep battling until somebody tells us that we're out of
  it.\"\n\nHaving trailed after five innings by six runs\, the Nationals 
 rallied for two in the sixth and five in the eighth and carried a 7-6 le
 ad into the ninth inning.\n\nReliever Chad Cordero couldn't close it out
 \, however. With a runner on first base\, Chipper Jones hit a 2-0 fastba
 ll over the right-center field wall to give the Braves an 8-7 lead.\n\n\
 "I fell behind Chipper\, and he made me pay for it\,\" Cordero said. \"I
  got beat with my best pitch. There's nothing I could say. I was trying 
 to throw a strike\, and I didn't.\"\n\nSaid Chipper on hitting the home 
 run\, \"I just got ahead in the count\, and that's where Andruw [Jones] 
 having a monster year gets me a pitch. It gets me a fastball. I like fas
 tballs.\"\n\nAndruw Jones followed and was behind 0-2 when he hit a solo
  shot into the upper deck in left field. It was his second home run of t
 he day\, the first of which set a new franchise record for homers in a s
 eason.\n\n\"That was just a messup from me\,\" Cordero said. \"I had him
  0-2\, and I threw a strike right down the middle. Why do that? I messed
  up. It was totally my fault. I tried to go down and away.\"\n\nAfter he
  induced Todd Hollandsworth to fly out to right fielder Jose Guillen to 
 end the inning\, Cordero was walked slowly toward the dugout with his mi
 tt in his mouth.\n\n\"It was very shocking\,\" Cordero said. \"I know I 
 messed up again. We battled all the way back\, and I blew it. It cost us
  a game. I feel terrible.\"\n\nCordero\, who suffered his sixth blown sa
 ve of the season\, took the loss\, while Atlanta's Macay McBride took th
 e win. Kyle Farnsworth pitched a perfect ninth to earn his 12th save of 
 the season\, his sixth with the Braves after recording six with the Tige
 rs.\n\nChurch said Cordero has nothing to be ashamed of.\n\n\"You win so
 me\, you lose some\,\" Church said. \"You are going to blow some games h
 ere and there\, but he goes out there every day and gives everything he 
 has. Look at the year he has had. There's no reason he should be down\, 
 because we are not going to be down on him. He has been a big part of wh
 at we have done this year.\"\n\nThe Nationals and Braves ended up splitt
 ing the 18-game season series\, with nine wins apiece.\n\nBraves starter
  John Smoltz had the Nationals under control for most of the game. In fa
 ct\, during a three-inning stretch -- the third\, fourth and fifth -- Sm
 oltz threw just 14 pitches.\n\nThe Nationals were able to get to Smoltz 
 in the bottom of the sixth inning\, when Short and Nick Johnson hit back
 -to-back home runs. By that time\, however\, the Braves already had what
  appeared to be a comfortable 6-2 lead.\n\nSmoltz ended up pitching seve
 n innings\, giving up two runs on three hits\, before taking himself out
  of the game because of shoulder stiffness. He threw 74 pitches\, 56 of 
 them strikes.\n\n\"He was getting ahead in the count early\,\" Short sai
 d. \"He was throwing a lot of strikes. Once he gets ahead\, he goes to t
 hat split-finger fastball. It's just a nasty pitch. We were trying to ju
 mp on him early in the count\, because a lot of guys don't want to get t
 o the split.\"\n\nThe Nationals had no choice but to go with a starter-b
 y-committee approach\, because they don't have a fourth or fifth starter
  due to shoulder injuries that have sidelined Tony Armas Jr. and Ryan Dr
 ese. The Nationals paid it for dearly.\n\nJason Bergmann started for the
  Nationals and gave up two runs in the first inning. Chipper Jones doubl
 ed home Rafael Furcal\, and Marcus Giles scored on a sacrifice fly by Ad
 am LaRoche.\n\nTravis Hughes took over in the third inning\, giving up A
 ndruw Jones' record-setting dinger to make it 3-0.\n\nJohn Halama entere
 d the game in the fourth and gave up a sacrifice fly to Furcal and an RB
 I double to Giles.\n\nIn the sixth\, with Mike Stanton on the mound\, th
 e Braves pushed across an unearned run. Furcal hit a ground ball to Shor
 t at second base. The ball got past Short for an error\, which allowed B
 rian McCann to score the sixth run of the game.\n\nWith Smoltz out of th
 e game\, the Nationals felt they could come back against the Braves' bul
 lpen\, as they have often done this season. In fact\, Washington did tak
 e the lead by scoring five runs in the eight inning against a trio of At
 lanta relievers.\n\nWith runners on first and second and John Foster on 
 the mound\, Brad Wilkerson singled to drive in Guzman. The run was charg
 ed to reliever Blaine Boyer.\n\nAfter Short was hit by a pitch to load t
 he bases\, Johnson hit a hard grounder that smacked LaRoche in the face.
  The ball caromed over near the Braves' dugout\, allowing Marlon Byrd an
 d Wilkerson to score on the play.\n\nReliever Chris Reitsma then entered
  the game. Jose Guillen flied out to center field to put runners on firs
 t and third. And Church followed with a sacrifice fly to score Short and
  tie the score at 6. Johnson took second on the play.\n\nZimmerman\, mak
 ing his first start at third base\, followed and singled to center to dr
 ive in Johnson and put the Nationals on top\, 7-6. That lead vanished\, 
 however\, when Chipper went deep in the ninth.\n\n\"It was a good comeba
 ck\; it's just that we didn't finish it off\,\" said Robinson. \"Those t
 hings happen in this game. You have the victory in your back pocket. You
  have three outs going into the ninth inning. You get two of them. You f
 eel very comfortable about it. You have your closer out there on the mou
 nd and he has been very successful\, and you feel the game should be in 
 the win column.\"\n\nThis story was not subject to the approval of Major

SUMMARY:(L) vs Marlins
DESCRIPTION:Loss: 4-8\n\nBy Bill Ladson / MLB.com\n\nWASHINGTON -- The N
 ationals needed right-hander John Patterson to go deep into Thursday nig
 ht's game against the Marlins because the bullpen has been overworked. W
 ashington's relievers pitched a combined 14 2/3 innings in the previous 
 two games.\nBut Patterson was unable to get the job done\, and the Marli
 ns pounded the Nationals\, 8-4\, in front of 27\,625 at Robert F. Kenned
 y Stadium.\n\nIt was supposed to be a pitchers' duel between Patterson a
 nd Marlins right-hander Josh Beckett\, but Patterson was no match for Be
 ckett with the arm or the bat.\n\nBeckett pitched 6 2/3 innings and gave
  up two runs on six hits. He struck out seven batters and walked one. Be
 ckett even had a good night at the plate\, hitting his first Major Leagu
 e home run and drawing a walk in another at-bat.\n\nOutfielder Marlon By
 rd said Beckett performed like the pitcher that won the 2003 World Serie
 s MVP. In fact\, Beckett struck out Byrd three times Thursday night.\n\n
 \"He had everything\,\" Byrd said. \"He got me out on fastballs\, change
 ups and curveballs. He was at 90-91 mph\, and then all of a sudden\, he 
 was at 97\, 98.\"\n\nPatterson\, on the other hand\, woke up on Thursday
  morning with a sinus infection\, and it ended up affecting him on the m
 ound. He lasted just 4 2/3 innings and gave up seven runs on nine hits. 
 Patterson struck out four and walked three.\n\nHe threw 105 pitches\, 66
  for strikes.\n\n\"I woke up with [the sinus infection] last night. I fe
 lt pretty bad all day\,\" Patterson said. \"I just didn't feel good. I h
 ad a high pitch count. I thought I was going to get out of the fourth in
 ning pretty quick and that didn't happened. It just wore me down. It zap
 ped my energy a little early in the game. Once it got my energy\, it got
  me mentally\, and the frustration started to show.\"\n\nThe Marlins wen
 t to work on Patterson right away in the first inning\, when Miguel Cabr
 era singled to left to drive in Luis Castillo and give the Marlins a 1-0
  lead.\n\nThe Nationals tied it up in the bottom of the inning on a sacr
 ifice fly by Jose Guillen\, but the Marlins would put the game away by t
 he fifth inning.\n\nIn the fourth\, Juan Pierre drove in the go-ahead ru
 n with a single to center field to drive in Damion Easley.\n\nPatterson'
 s frustration would come to a boil in that same inning. After Pierre was
  called safe on a stolen base attempt\, Patterson tossed his glove in th
 e air out of frustration.\n\nThird base umpire Tim McClelland\, also the
  crew chief\, went to the mound\, and according to manager Frank Robinso
 n\, \"reamed out\" Patterson. According to Patterson\, McClelland though
 t the right-hander was showing up second base umpire Tim Timmons\, who m
 ade the safe call on Pierre. McClelland was not available for comment.\n
 \n\"I was surprised I did it myself\, but that's how frustrated I am\,\"
  Patterson said. \"I was frustrated about the pitching. There wasn't any
 thing going right. I shouldn't have flipped the glove\, but he definitel
 y shouldn't have done what he did. I really wasn't listening to him\, bu
 t he was pretty hot about me throwing my glove. He thought I was showing
  the umpire up\, and that's not what I was doing at all.\"\n\nRobinson t
 hen went to McClelland to find out why he made such a big deal about Pat
 terson flipping his glove.\n\n\"I told him\, 'You don't ream one of my p
 itchers out\,'\" Robinson said. \"What you should have done is tell him\
 , 'Don't [toss the glove] again.'\"\n\nPatterson said he wasn't rattled 
 by McClelland\, but\, in the fifth inning\, the Marlins batted around an
 d scored five runs\, highlighted by the Beckett home run.\n\n\"There was
  a ball in the hole after ball in the hole\,\" Patterson said. \"I'm get
 ting the ground balls and getting the pitches. Balls are dropping in all
  over the place. I don't know what more I could have done. McClelland di
 dn't rattle me. That's for sure.\"\n\nThe Nationals got a run back in th
 e bottom of the inning on an RBI single by Cristian Guzman.\n\nCabrera g
 ot that run back in the sixth inning\, when he hit his 30th home run of 
 the season off reliever Jon Rauch.\n\nThe Nationals scored two runs in t
 he ninth inning off Guillermo Mota.\n\nThe Nationals are now four games 
 behind the Astros in the Wild Card race\, and they will face the Braves 
 this weekend.\n\n\"We haven't been playing well\, and we let a lot of pe
 ople down\,\" Guillen said. \"I don't know what we need to do to fight b
 ack. We have a lot of games left. Anything can happen in this game. Fran
 k needs to look at what we need to fix and be successful. I hope he can 
 start making some changes. It's up to him.\"\n\nThis story was not subje

 NGTON -- The Rangers played home run derby on right-hander Tony Armas Jr
 . and pounced on the Nationals\, 7-4\, in front of 48\,663 fans at Ameri
 quest Field on Saturday night.\nIt was the Nationals' second consecutive
  loss\, and the last time they lost two games in a row was in late May\,
  when they lost five straight.\n\nHow bad was Armas' outing? It was remi
 niscent of his last game in 2003. On April 20 of that year\, he gave up 
 four home runs against the Reds in Puerto Rico and it turned out that he
  had a torn rotator cuff and labrum. He missed close to two years of act
 ion.\n\nAs he was giving up home runs to the Rangers -- four in all -- o
 n Saturday\, Armas admitted he thought of that 2003 game. The difference
  was\, however\, that Armas' right shoulder was sound against the Ranger
 s. But his offspeed pitches betrayed him the first two innings\, especia
 lly against Mark Teixeira\, who went 3-for-4 with two home runs and four
  RBIs.\n\nIn the first\, with Michael Young on first base and one out\, 
 Teixeira took Armas' 1-0 pitch and hit a ball that looked like it was go
 ing to foul territory\, but the ball hit the foul pole for a two-run hom
 er.\n\nWith two outs in the same inning\, Alfonso Soriano hit a solo hom
 er to give the Rangers a 3-0 lead.\n\nBy the second inning\, Teixeira di
 d further damage and the Rangers had a 7-0 lead. With no outs\, Gary Mat
 thews Jr. hit a two-run home run to give the Rangers a 5-0 advantage. Wi
 th one out in the same inning and David Dellucci on third base\, Teixeir
 a hit another two-run homer. This time it was an opposite-field shot.\n\
 n\"Teixeira is a good hitter. What a lineup! They have some great young 
 hitters. You just have to make your pitches\,\" Armas said. \"I threw a 
 changeup in the first inning and Teixeira had a good hack on it\, and th
 e curveball was away and he went the other way.\"\n\nArmas ended up shut
 ting out the Rangers over the next three innings before being replaced b
 y reliever Hector Carrasco.\n\n\"It's tough when you make mistakes\, esp
 ecially in a park like this. The ball flies\,\" Armas said. \"But I was 
 happy that I came back strong the last three innings\, but the only thin
 g was\, it was too late. There was nothing you could do. I didn't give m
 y team a chance to win.\"\n\nManager Frank Robinson\, known this year fo
 r giving pitchers quick hooks when they don't have solid outings\, kept 
 Armas in the game longer than expected because he was short on pitchers.
 \n\nReliever T.J. Tucker was placed on the disabled list on Saturday and
  his replacement\, right-hander Travis Hughes\, did not make Saturday's 
 game. Plus\, Robinson didn't want to use righty Gary Majewski\, whom Rob
 inson feels is tired.\n\nIn fact\, no one warmed up in the bullpen until
  the fifth inning.\n\n\"I didn't think Tony had to bite the bullet. He o
 nly threw 102 pitches. I couldn't go to the bullpen in the second inning
 . I have only four pitchers out there\,\" Robinson said. \"He had to giv
 e me at least five innings and that was it. Tony didn't give up any more
  runs. He pitched very well his last three innings.\"\n\nRichardo Rodrig
 uez was the starter for the Rangers and he pitched seven-plus solid inni
 ngs and gave up three runs on six hits.\n\n\"He didn't have anything spe
 cial. We just didn't hit today\,\" said Ryan Church\, who had the first 
 multihomer game of his career\, going deep twice. \"We have to go [to th
 e hotel]\, regroup and come back tomorrow.\"\n\nAll three runs off Rodri
 guez were scored on home runs as Church hit a solo shot in the fourth in
 ning and Cristian Guzman hit a two-run homer in the eighth inning.\n\nFo
 r Guzman\, it was his second home run in as many nights. He is now hitti
 ng .291 for the month of June to raise his overall batting average to .2
 06. Robinson\, however\, declined to say if Guzman is back on track with
  the bat.\n\n\"One more night isn't going to make me jump off the bridge
 . Let me see [Guzman hit] during a one- or two-week period\,\" Robinson 
 said. \"It's encouraging and hopefully he'll continue to give us those t
 ype of at-bats down in the lineup\, or up at the top.\"\n\nChurch hit an
 other home run off Kameron Loe in the ninth inning\, but the outfielder 
 said he is still not feeling right. He is still experiencing headaches a
 fter being hit on the right side of the face by a foul ball on Tuesday. 
 He also has a mild left groin strain and a sore right pinky toe after be
 ing drilled by a Scot Shields pitch. Both injuries came during the Angel
 s series.\n\n\"I had two home runs\, but it really doesn't matter. We lo
 st\,\" Church said. \"I still feel like crap\, but you have to battle th
 rough and keep going. They need me in there.\"\n\nThe Nationals are 39-2
 9 and in first place in the National League East\, 1 1/2 games ahead of 
 the Phillies.\n\nThis story was not subject to the approval of Major Lea

 .com\n\nTORONTO -- The Nationals seem to have lost their bats somewhere 
 between Washington and Toronto. For their sake\, they had better find th
 em quickly.\nA day after Blue Jays pitchers Ted Lilly and Pete Walker ga
 ve up just a single run\, Toronto ace Roy Halladay stonewalled Washingto
 n again as the Jays defeated the Nationals\, 7-0\, to jump out to a 2-0 
 lead in this three-game set.\n\n\"We haven't been swinging the bats that
  well\,\" first baseman Nick Johnson admitted. \"We need to get some qua
 lity at-bats every time out and see if we can't get something going.\"\n
 \nThe Nationals actually got things going early on against the 2003 Amer
 ican League Cy Young Award winner. After a 1-2-3 first inning\, Washingt
 on generated three hits in the second\, including a double by Jeffrey Ha
 mmonds. But Jays second baseman Orlando Hudson turned an unassisted doub
 le play\, and Halladay struck out Brian Schneider with Ryan Church and H
 ammonds in scoring position to end the threat.\n\nThe following inning\,
  Washington was able to load the bases\, but Vinny Castilla left the bag
 s full by hitting into a forceout. After that\, it was all Halladay (7-2
 )\, who shook off the shaky start to record his third consecutive win. T
 he Toronto right-hander threw seven shutout innings\, including retiring
  the last 13 batters he faced\, before being lifted in the eighth for Sc
 ott Schoeneweis.\n\n\"He had his stuff moving today and did a good job\,
 \" Johnson said.\n\nThe Nationals stranded five runners in the first thr
 ee innings before Halladay put it in cruise control. After taking an hou
 r to complete the first three frames\, the next six took more than an ho
 ur\, thanks in large part to Halladay's quick pace on the mound\, which 
 seemed to keep the Nationals' hitters off balance.\n\n\"Everybody's diff
 erent\, but he gets it and goes\,\" Johnson said.\n\nOverall\, Halladay 
 and two relievers retired the final 19 Washington batters they faced.\n\
 nNationals starter Tony Armas Jr. (1-2)\, who was making just his third 
 start of the season after rehabbing a groin injury sustained in the spri
 ng\, pitched seven innings\, allowing seven runs on 10 hits.\n\nArmas\, 
 who has now allowed seven runs in two of his last five starts dating bac
 k to last year\, said that he felt fine physically\, but was just a vict
 im of some bad luck.\n\n\"I would have liked to at least given my team a
  chance to win\, but they had some good swings\,\" Armas said. \"It was 
 one of those days where everything they hit fell in. It was tough.\"\n\n
 The Blue Jays jumped out to a quick 2-0 lead in the first after Alex Rio
 s' RBI triple and Shea Hillenbrand's sacrifice fly. Toronto doubled its 
 lead an inning later with a run-scoring double by Aaron Hill and Hudson'
 s RBI single.\n\nBut where Toronto was capitalizing on its opportunities
  early\, Washington was squandering them.\n\n\"We have to be more patien
 t at the plate\,\" Brad Wilkerson said. \"As a whole team right now\, we
  are trying to make a difference with one swing of the bat\, and that's 
 not a good situation\, especially with a guy like (Halladay). You have t
 o go up and make him get the ball up in the zone.\"\n\nEric Hinske added
  a two-run homer in the sixth to make it 6-0\, and Frank Catalanotto's s
 ingle brought home Hudson\, who had tripled a batter before\, to cap the
  scoring in the seventh.\n\n\"As a team we have to have maturity and con
 fidence to make the pitcher work and get on base any way we can\,\" Wilk
 erson said. \"We're just up there swinging early. Today we were down fou
 r runs and it seemed like we swung at the first pitch for three or four 
 innings in a row. That's not good baseball. We have to have better quali
 ty at-bats.\"\n\nDespite Armas' early-game inconsistencies\, manager Fra
 nk Robinson was not going to give his young righty the hook. Instead\, h
 e let Armas work in and out of jams\, opting to give his relievers some 
 rest.\n\n\"You just can't go out there and take people out in the second
  and third innings\,\" Robinson said. \"Our bullpen is just not equipped
  for that. I just felt like if he could get innings for us\, it would be
  a good thing\, because it didn't look like offensively we weren't going
  to get a lot.\"\n\nThe offense hasn't been getting much lately\, as the
  Nationals have now scored seven runs in their last five games. This lac
 k of jet fuel has the skipper concerned heading into the series finale S
 unday afternoon.\n\n\"It just seems like the offense is a little flat\, 
 especially when we get down a little bit\,\" Robinson said. \"We can't g
 et the big hit.\"\n\nThis story was not subject to the approval of Major
